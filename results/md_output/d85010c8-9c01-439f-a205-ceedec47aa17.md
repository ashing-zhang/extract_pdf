Representitive Results
Overal Architecture
Environment Preparing
1 python3.5
You should prepare at least 3 1080ti gpus or change the batch size.

pip install -r requirement.txt mkdir model Download VGG pretrained model from
[Google Drive 1], and then put it into the directory model.
Training process
Before starting training process, you should launch the visdom.server for visualizing.
nohup python -m visdom.server -port=8097
then run the following command
python scripts/script.py --train
Testing process
Download pretrained model and put it into ./checkpoints/enlightening
Create directories ../test_dataset/testA and ../test_dataset/testB. Put your
test images on ../test_dataset/testA (And you should keep whatever one image in ../
test_dataset/testB to make sure program can start.)
Run
python scripts/script.py --predict
Dataset preparing
Training data [Google Drive] (unpaired images collected from multiple datasets)
Testing data [Google Drive] (including LIME, MEF, NPE, VV, DICP)
And [BaiduYun] is available now thanks to @YHLelaine!
