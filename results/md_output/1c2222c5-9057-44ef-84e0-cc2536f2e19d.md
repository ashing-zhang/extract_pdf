Install Seaglass

you’ll be able to use the built in auto updating feature to ensure you have the latest version.
1 brew cask install seaglass
Building from source
Use Xcode 9.4 or Xcode 10.0 on macOS 10.13. Seaglass may require macOS 10.13 as a result of using
auto‑layout for some table views, which seems to have been introduced with High Sierra. I hope to
find an alternate way to relax this requirement.

At this stage it is early in development and stands a good chance of being buggy and unreliable. I’m

code is probably awful. You’ve been warned. :‑)
