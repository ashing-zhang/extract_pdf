Supplemental Results 
 
Results Based on Occlusion Location at Presentation: 
41/226 (18%) patients demonstrated an ICA occlusion at presentation, of which 32 (78%) received 
bridging  therapy  (BT).  Excellent  outcomes  (BT:  12  (38%)  vs  dEVT:  3  (33%),  p>0.99)  and 
functional independence (BT: 16 (50%) vs dEVT: 4 (44%), aOR: 0.62, 95% CI=0.11-3.50, p=0.59) 
were numerically higher in patients who received BT. Similarly, an ordinal analysis also failed to 
demonstrate a significant improvement in functional outcomes with the use of bridging therapy 
(adj. cOR: 0.68, 95% CI=0.14-3.27, p=0.63).  
 
Of 136 (60%) patients with an M1 occlusion, 99 (73%) received BT and 37 (27%) were treated 
with dEVT approach. The rate of excellent outcomes (BT: 40 (40%) vs dEVT: 12 (32%), p=0.40) 
and functional independence (BT: 55 (56%) vs dEVT:  16 (43%), aOR; 2.32, 95% CI= 0.80-5.80, 
p=0.11)  were  similar  between  patients  who  did  and  did  not  receive  bridging  therapy.  No 
improvement in functional outcome was observed in patients receiving IV alteplase after adjusting 
for covariates (adj. cOR: 2.18, 95% CI=0.92-4.54, p=0.12). 
 
49/226 (22%) patients exhibited M2 occlusion. And of these, 31 (63%) patients received IV 
alteplase administration. Numerically higher rates of excellent outcomes (BT: 17 (55%) vs 
dEVT: 6 (33%), p=0.15) and functional independence (BT: 21 (68%) vs dEVT: 8 (44%), aOR: 
2.86, 95% CI: 0.54-15.05, p=0.22). An ordinal analysis of functional outcomes also did not show 
a significant improvement with IV alteplase administration (adj. cOR: 3.32, 95% CI=0.64-16.34, 
p=0.18).  
 
Multiplicative interaction terms between clot location and bridging therapy use were not 
statistically significant (using ICA and dEVT as reference categories and a two-way interaction 
between clot location and IV tPA use: p-value for multiplicative interaction between M1 and IV 
tPA: 0.19, p-value for multiplicative interaction between M2 and IV tPA: 0.15).
