Abstract 
The preservation of architectural heritage from natural hazards and catastrophic events, including 
the seismic risk, requires in-depth investigation on structural  behavior and in particular on the 
dynamic response of monumental and existing buildings, such as masonry structures. The support 
of experimental tests, dynamic identification techniques together with structural monitoring allow 
to  a  non-destructive  evaluation  of  dynamic  parameters  and  more  in  general  for  the  seismic 
vulnerability  assessment  of  heritage  buildings,  preserving  its  integrity  and  considering  its 
operational status. In this paper, an experimental campaign on unreinforced masonry (URM) walls 
is  presented  on  three typologies  of walls  considering  induced  damage.  A  methodology  for the 
investigation of dynamic behavior of damaged URM walls proposed to support the most common 
dynamic identification techniques pointing out information through a simple spectral estimation.

is clearly identifiable by Transient_1 signal of each 
channel.  Regarding  the  response  in  Transient_2 
signal,  the  associated  frequency  spectra  do  not 
detect clear peak amplitudes and it seems that the 
energy of the signals is such to excite mainly the 
higher  value  of  frequency  (around  70  Hz)  with 
respect  the  other  transient  responses  as  it  is 
shown in Figure 5. In Transient_3 signal, additional 
peaks  in  the  frequency  range  33-36  Hz  are 
identified with higher amplitudes with respect the 
 
first mode. The evaluated FFT spectra compared

channels  in  Figure  6.  According  to  this,  the 
frequency peak identified by Transient_2 around 
70 Hz, cannot be considered related to a mode of 
the wall, it disappears with the time probably due 
to the lower excitation of this signal. This allows to 
evaluate  the  reliability  of  the  identified 
frequencies.  It  allows  to  identify  four  stable 
frequencies:  a  first  bending  mode  and  two 
torsional  modes  at  two  close  frequencies  as 
shown in Figure 7. The last one can be considered 
as a local mode related to the left upper part of 
the wall. The corresponding frequency is 71,4 Hz, 
very  close  to  the  peak  identified  by  Transient_2 
signal associated to a low amplitude of FFT. This is 
 
in  agreement  with  the  stabilization  chart  where 
also  the  related  amplitude  peak  is  very  low.  Figure 6. Frequency spectra and spectrograms for

During  the  execution  of  SC  test,  observing  the 
sequence  of  loading  and  pause  steps,  at  the 
increase  of  horizontal  load  the  beginning  of  the 
pause  phases  is  characterized  by  a  loss  of  load 
which  becomes  greater  in  the steps  at the time 
where the cracking of the panel occurred.

Observing the plot of acquired signals during this 
step,  they  can  be  considered  as  a  typical  noise 
signal.  Then  it  is  useful  to  evaluate  the  power 
spectrum of each signal to estimate the frequency 
content and the distribution of energy associated 
to each one. A summary plot is shown in Figure 9. 
The  frequency  values  with  higher  density  of
