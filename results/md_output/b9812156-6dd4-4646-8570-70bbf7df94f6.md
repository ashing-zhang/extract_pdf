Study Identifier 
[INT] 
Unique identifier 
The identifier is composed of a 5-digit code: the first two letters refer to the country (EC, PE, BO, VE, 
etc), the three numbers are consecutive numbering of the studies.  
When the study contains different type of information, then the study is coded twice, with a 
different ID.

Each study will be georeferenced in longitude and latitude (decimal degrees) in the WGS84 Geodetic 
System. If coordinates of the site are given in another coordinate system, a transformation has been 
applied using the online convertor available on: https://epsg.io/ 
If a range of coordinates is given for a given site, we used the centroid of the study area. If a given 
study resumes information from different sites, each site is included as a separate observation.

“The map of the distribution of Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) ecological systems includes 
modeled ecological systems that occur within South America. Five input data layers - elevation 
(SRTM, 2000), landform (SRTM, 2000 and WWF-Hydrosheds, 2005), geology (TNC and GDS, 2005), 
landcover (GLC, 2000) and bioclimate (WorldClim, 2004 and TNC, 2005) - were combined to produce a 
map of unique ecological system footprint gridcodes. These gridcodes were then evaluated and 
attributed to one of NatureServe's Latin America and Caribbean Ecological Systems.”

Experimental design 
[TEXT], Lookup table 
Based on the manual by Nichols et al. (2011), the study type is identified according to the following 
table. We added the option to include studies that lack a specific sampling design (type: “other”) 
Other   No specific sampling design 
Descriptive studies 
After Impact   Comparison of variable(s) from impact locations with a standard from 
literature or other but not with control/reference location/s, and with no 
data from impacted site (before/after) 
Control/Ref vs. Impact  Any case where reference/control locations are being compared to impact 
location w/o before-impact data for the impact locations. May include 
cases where locations are compared to output from models based on 
reference/control locations.  
Multiple Control/Ref vs.  Multiple Control/Reference locations and 1 or many impact locations. Or, 
Impact  multiple impact locations and 1 or many control/reference locations. No 
Before/After.  
Before After with no  Any case where variable(s) are compared before and after the onset of 
reference/control data  changes with no reference/control 
Gradient Response  Any case with investigation of an association between causal agent and 
response variable along a causal-agent gradient. Data may include locations 
with different degree of disturbance. Gradients may also occur through 
time.  
Before After Control/Ref and  Before After Control Impact or Before After Reference Impact, with 1 
Impact  control/reference location, 1 impact location. Compares changes at two 
locations (control/reference and Impact location) before and after the 
impact 
Before After Control/Ref and  Before After Control Impact or Before After Reference Impact, with 1 
Impact and Paired study  control/reference location, 1 impact location. Sampled through time at the 
same times, I.e. paired measurements from control and impact locations. 
Sampling through time during long intervals during the before/after periods 
is used to estimate the temporal variation in the differences between 
control and impact locations. The temporal variation is used to assess the 
average difference before and after the impact starts. The time intervals 
are large enough to prevent autocorrelation, and are viewed as a random 
sample of possible values in each time period.  
Multiple Control/Ref locations  Multiple Control/Reference locations and 1 or many impact locations. Or, 
or Impact locations  multiple impact locations and 1 or many control/reference locations. Can 
include replication in time

•  RC = plot runoff coefficient (determined as event-based runoff coefficient from rainfall 
simulation experiments, in %),  
•  SSY = specific sediment yield (determined as the catchment-wide sediment yield per surface 
area, in abandoned cropland or degraded land with very low (< 10 %) vegetation cover.  ),  
•  RCC = catchment-wide runoff ratio (determined as the annual total runoff ratio of the 
catchment, in %). 
•  SOC (total soil organic carbon of the uppermost soil horizon, between 5 and 30 cm, in %) 
•  BD (dry bulk density of the topsoil horizon, between 5 and 30 cm, in g.cm-3). 
 
The indicators for three natural infrastructure interventions (PRO, FOR and SWC) are compared with 
untreated areas under traditional agriculture, either cropland (CROP) or rangeland (RANGE), and 
bare land (BARE). Bare land corresponds to abandoned cropland or degraded land with very low (< 
10 %) vegetation cover.
