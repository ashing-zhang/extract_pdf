1.2 SOP Summary 
 
Title  
 
 
Brewing with Faba Beans – Enzymes for Mash Optimisation 
 
 
Brief description  
 
 
In  the  production  of  beer,  the  processing  step  known  as  ‘mashing’  involves  the 
gelatinisation of the raw materials’ starch, its enzymatic degradation into simple sugars, 
and the separation and removal of solid material. The efficiency of this step is critical in the 
production of beer as the amount of fermentable sugar produced directly impacts the 
alcohol content of the end beer. Preliminary experiments have found, however, that when 
faba bean accounts for a high proportion of the beer recipe the efficiency of this step is 
negatively impacted with slow solid removal and reduced yields. 
 
In addition to starch, other polysaccharides, such as β-glucans and arabinoxylans are also 
broken down during the mashing process which can cause both processability issues, such 
as poor filtration and reduced yields, and final product issues through haze formation. The 
addition  of  commercial  enzymes  is  an  established  practice  to  increase  levels  of  
fermentable sugars, nitrogen availability and wort run off rate.  
 
This SOP provides a method to assess the impact of enzymatic additions on mash viscosity 
and wort run off rate. A rheometer method has been developed to recreate two typical 
mashing regimes. Samples are milled to produce a fine grist. A fixed amount of the grist is 
then used to form a slurry with a calculated weight of water with enzyme additions and run 
on  a  pre-set  rheometer  programme.  The  programme  consists  of  an  initial  rapid  stir 
followed by continuous stirring as one of two potential mashing temperature regimes are 
followed. The slurry is then filtered, and the volume of filtrate recorded over time.

2 Protocol Steps  
 
 
1. Experimental Design 
A full two-level factorial design was employed to study the effect of mashing regime, protease 
and carbohydrase additions on viscosity development during gelatinisation of the starch as 
well as the wort run off rate.  
 
2. Preparation of Samples 
•  All sample material should be milled to a particle size of less than 0.1 mm. 
•  The moisture content of each flour sample must be determined prior to analysis to ensure 
accurate standardised results as these are used to calculate the ratio of flour to water to 
be used. 
•  The moisture content of the flours (minimum of 0.4 g) was established by a gravimetric 
method using a Mettler-Toledo LJ16 infrared dryer (Mettler-Toledo GmbH, Laboratory & 
Weighing Technologies, CH-8606 Greifensee, Switzerland).  
 
3. Sample Weight Calculation 
•  3.0g +/- 0.01g flour and 25.0 +/- 0.1mL distilled water is required to run one experiment.  
Under normal circumstances, however, the amount of sample is adjusted to take account 
of the moisture present within it as follows: 
 
Weight of flour to be used (g) =  M2 = (100 – 14) x M1 / (100 – W1) 
 
Volume of water to be used (mL) = W2 = 25.0 + (M1 – M2) 
 
      M1 = sample weight of the material to be tested (3.0g +/- 0.01g as is) 
      M2 = sample mass corrected to 14% moisture (g) 
      W1 = actual moisture content of the sample (% as is) 
      W2 = corrected water volume (mL) 
 
4. Enzyme Additions 
•  Although  this  SOP  can  be  used  to  assess  the  impact  of  any  enzymatic  additions  the 
functional characteristics of the commercial enzymes which were currently selected to 
improve saccharification, liquification and run off rate of the wort(s) are presented in Table 
1.   
•  The enzymes used include: an α-amylase, for the liquefaction of starch via hydrolysis of 
1,4-alpha glucosidic linkages; an amyloglucosidase, for the saccharification of liquefied 
starch through hydrolysis of 1,4- and 1,6-  alpha glucosidic linkages; a endoprotease, for

the hydrolysis of peptide bonds; and, a mixed carbohydrase, for the breakdown of cell wall 
material.

6. Running the programme 
•  Measure the desired volume of water, calculated as described in section 2, into the test cell. 
•  Allow the test cell and water to preheat to 40oC for the stepped regime or 64°C for the 
simple regime. 
•  Weigh out the desired quantity of test material, calculated as described in section 2, into a 
weigh boat and tip into the test cell. 
•  Add the necessary enzyme additions. 
•  Lower the rotor and initiate the programme per the operating software’s instructions. 
 
7. Analysis of Rheometer Results 
Once  the  programme  has  finished,  the  profiles  can  be  displayed,  compared  and  data 
extracted per the operating software’s instructions. 
 
8. Filtration Rate 
•  Following completion of the rheometer programme the contents of the test cell is filtered  
through Whatman No. 1 filter paper, and the volume of filtrate collected recorded at 5 
minute intervals for a period of 30 minutes. 
 
9. Analysis of Data 
The rheometer and filtrate collection data were analysed for statistically significant impact 
using a statistical software package.
