1.2 SOP Summary 
 
Title  
 
 
Antioxidant assay 5: Superoxide dismutase (SOD) 
 
 
Brief description  
 
 
Superoxide dismutase catalyses the breakdown of superoxide radical anion and provides the 
first line of defence against oxygen toxicity. It therefore provides a good indication as to 
whether a plant is under stress or not. Superoxide dismutase (EC 1.15.1.1) designates the 
variety of metalloproteins containing Cu2+, Zn2+, Mn3+ or Fe3+ as an active metal cofactor that 
catalyse the dismutation of the superoxide radical anion into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. 
Cu/ZnSOD is located in the cytosol and chloroplast of the plant cell, MnSOD is in the matrix of 
the mitochondria and peroxisomes.

2 Protocol Steps  
 
1st stage: Enzyme Extraction 
0.1 g of each pulverized, frozen sample (leaf and root samples) was homogenised with ice-cold 
25 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.8). The HEPES buffer contained 0.2 mM EDTA, 2 mM ascorbate and 2 % 
(w/v) polyvinylpyrolidon (PVP). The homogenates were centrifuged at 4 °C and 14,000 rpm. The 
supernatants obtained were used for enzyme analysis. The procedure for enzyme extraction was 
carried out at 0-4 oC.  
 
Reagents 
 
To prepare 1 L of the necessary reagents, the following equation was used: 
 
                                                                            m = C * V * M                                            (equation 1) 
 
with    m = weight (g) 
           C = molarity (mol/L) 
           V = volume to be prepared (L) 
           MB = molecular weight (g/mol) 
 
 
•  25 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.8)  
Weigh 5.9575 g of HEPES (MB = 238.30) in a 1 L volumetric flask and adjust to 1 L with H O (m 
2
= 0.025 * 1 * 238.30). Adjust the pH to 7.8 using either a diluted HCl or NaOH solution. 
 
•  0.2 mM EDTA 
Weigh 0.0745 g of EDTA (MB = 372.24) in a 1 L volumetric flask and adjust to 1 L with H O (m = 
2
0.0002 * 1 * 372.24). 
 
•  2 mM ascorbate (AsA)  
Weigh 0.352 g of Ascorbate (MB = 176.12) in a 1 L volumetric flask and adjust to 1 L with H O 
2
(m = 0.002 * 1 * 176.12). 
 
•  2% (W/V) polyvinylpyrolidon PVP 
▪  2 g in 100 mL

Antioxidant assay 5: 
 
Superoxide dismutase (SOD) 
 
 
 
 
 
2nd stage: Measuring Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) 
 
Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was assayed according to Rao and Sresty (2000) with small 
modifications.  
 
200µL of reaction mixture containing 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.8), 100 mM methionine, 1 
mM nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT), 0.1 mM EDTA, 10µl leaf extract or 25 µL root extract and 2 µM 
riboflavin started the reaction. The samples were incubated at room temperature under a lamp for 
15 minutes before measuring the absorption of NBT at 560 nm, with Anthos Zenyth 240 96-well 
microplate  absorbance  reader  spectrophotometer  (Anthos  Mikrosysteme  GmbH,  Germany).  A 
reaction mixture without the plant extract was used as control; while a non-irradiated complete 
reaction mixture served as blank. The ADAP BASIC Software for device control and data transfer to 
PC was used.  
 
Reagents for the preparation of the reaction mixture: 
 
•  100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.8)  
1M K HPO  
2 4
Since the molar mass of K HPO  is 174.1760 g/mol, a 1 M solution would be 174.1760 g in 1L.  
2 4
1M KH PO  
2 4
Since the molar mass of KH PO  is 136.0857 g/mol, a 1 M solution would be 136.0857 g in 1L.  
2 4
Preparation of 1L of 0.1 M = 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer at 25 °C 
Desired pH  Volume of 1M K HPO  (mL)  Volume of 1M KH PO  (mL) 
2 4 2 4
7.0  90.8  9.2 
Hence, for the preparation of 100 mL of 0.1 M = 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer at 25 °C 
 Desired pH  Volume of 1M K HPO  (mL)  Volume of 1M KH PO  (mL) 
2 4 2 4
7.0  9.08  0.92 
 
Add the volume indicated in the table above in a 100 mL volumetric flask and adjust to 100 mL with 
H O. 
2
 
•  13 mM methionine 
To prepare 10 mL of a 13 mM solution of methionine, weigh 19,397 g of methionine (MB = 
149.21) in a 10 mL volumetric flask and adjust to 10 L with H O (m = 0.013 * 10 * 149.21 from 
2
equation 1).

3rd stage: Calculations 
 
One unit of SOD is defined as the volume of extract that caused inhibition of the photo-reduction of 
NBT by 50%. First with the absorbance measured, calculate the units of activity (C) using equation 
4: 
 
C = (0.5* A )/ A                                              (equation 2) 
conc ext
 
with    C = Units of activity (units)  
A  = Absorbance of the control (without extract) 
conc
A  = Absorption of sample with extract 
ext
  
To calculate the superoxide dismutase activity (U), use equation 3 below: 
 
U = C / FM                                         (equation 3) 
 
•  U = Activity (units /g FM) 
•  FM = gram of the fresh material (g)

Antioxidant assay 5: 
 
Superoxide dismutase (SOD) 
 
 
 
 
 
From this, you can also calculate the superoxide dismutase activity per protein (U’) by dividing U by 
the protein content in grams (Equation 6).  
 
U΄ (units gr-1 protein] = U/ Protein content (g)1
