1.  Summary  
For the 9-month report, summarise the key activities, results, and achievements for the reporting period of 
January to September each year. 
Maximum 500 words, 1 page.  
This part will be used and published in other public deliverables, for instance the annual report. It should 
therefore be a standalone and clear as a separate document. 
 
A literature review has been written on the role of wild birds in dissemination and persistence of antimicrobial 
resistance (AMR) in the farm environment. The review includes sections on identifying the current situation 
regarding AMR in different environments; drivers for AMR; the role of vectors and the environment in 
persistence  and  dissemination  of  AMR;  the  role  of  AMR  surveillance;  and  evaluation  of  different 
methodologies for identifying AMR, both by phenotype and genotype, in bacteria. The student is updating 
this as new research is published. 
 
Pig and presumptive gull faecal samples were collected over three time points in October 2017, 2018, and 
2019 from a low antimicrobial usage pig farm as part of the APHA’s work on the ARDIG project within the 
One Health European Joint Programme (https://onehealthejp.eu/jrp-ardig/). In total, 632 E. coli were isolated 
from pig and gull faeces (n=342 and n=290 respectively). E. coli ST 744 (31.5%), 10 (14.2%), 88 (10.7%), and 
44 (8.4%) were most prevalent, and were also the only ST types present in both gull and pig faeces. Over 44% 
of pig isolates from non-selective agar harboured 1-12 AMR genes, and 36% of gull isolates harboured up to 
15 AMR genes. The majority of ST744s were isolated from ciprofloxacin supplemented plates and harboured 
multiple AMR genes. The presence of E. coli strains of the same ST type in both gull and pig faeces across 
multiple time points indicates the persistence of antimicrobial resistance in the farm environment and the 
possible transmission or exchange of multi-drug resistant E. coli between these compartments. 
 
Another  outdoor  pig  farm,  known  to  have  wild  birds  persistently  present  on  farm, was  recruited  for a 
longitudinal  study  and  visited  in  September  2021.  The  student  used  antibiotic-free  and  antibiotic-
supplemented agar plates to isolate over 1400 isolates from 151 environmental samples collected.  A mixture 
of Escherichia coli and Non-Escherichia coli were isolated based on their appearance on the chromogenic agar.  
Biochemical and MALDI-ToF testing has been carried out to speciate all isolates before they were frozen down.  
A subset of 475 isolates were selected and DNA was extracted and sent for whole genome sequencing.  The 
student has used Kraken to further speciate the isolates and is now carrying out downstream sequencing 
analysis to determine the AMR gene content of these isolates. 
 
The student attended the OHEJP ASM 2022 meeting in person where they delivered an oral presentation on 
their PhD, took part in the 3MT competition, and participated in the EJP PhD student round table discussion 
as part of communicating their research. The student won the prize for the best oral presentation by an early 
career researcher at the OHEJP ASM 2022. The student has also presented their work at a GW4 AMR Alliance 
(a collaboration between the University of Bath, the University of Bristol, Cardiff University & the University 
of Exeter) event and at the University of Exeter College of Medicine and Health Post Graduate Conference. 
The  student  has  attended  workshops  run  by  GW4  AMR  Alliance  and  a  symposium  on  ‘Research  and 
innovation to reduce the burden of antibiotic resistance: strengthening the European action’, in order to 
further develop their skill set for tasks later on in the project.

Please include: 
•  describe the key scientific results for the reporting period of January to September each year.  
•  a description of the project activities per task, plus detailed changes and any deviations compared to the 
annual work plan to which this 9 month report applies and the reason(s) for these differences.  
•  PI’s may be requested to update the initial Annual Work Plans if the deviations reported are considered 
very significant. 
•  Please provide enough detail to enable the research to be understood, without the need for additional 
information. Wherever possible, link this to a specific task in the original PhD work plan describing the WP#, 
Task# and Task Name.  
 
 
•  Milestone 1 - Collection of microbiological samples for longitudinal study (COMPLETED) 
Due to the number of samples collected and bacteria isolated from the farm visit in September 2021, the 
decision has been made to not collect any further samples across other timepoints and instead to do an 
in-depth cross-sectional study. The student collected 151 samples which resulted in over 1500 bacteria 
being isolated. A subset of 475 isolates (197  E. coli and 278 non-E. coli) have been whole genome 
sequenced and are undergoing downstream analysis of the sequence data using bioinformatic tools. 
 
•  Milestone 2 – Molecular analysis of bacterial isolates and antimicrobial resistance (Due M60) 
The student has carried out molecular analysis of E. coli ST744 isolates from pig and gull isolates collected 
as part of the APHA’s work on the ARDIG project. This was the most dominant ST type amongst the 
isolates and so phylogenetic and SNP based analysis was carried out to determine how closely related 
the strains are across both species and timepoints. Further ST744 isolates from other ARDIG partners and 
online databases were included in this analysis to further identify how clonal this population is and the 
likelihood for interspecies transmission between the gulls and the pigs on the APHA farm. 
 
The student has used Kraken to speciate the 475 isolates collected as part of their cross-sectional study. 
APHA Seqfinder and abricate are being used to identify the presence of AMR genes in the isolates. This 
work is still ongoing. 
 
•  Milestone 3 - Characterisation of mobile elements transmitting/proliferating AMR (Due M60) 
The  student  has  been  further  characterising  a  large,  multi-drug  resistant transposon  that  has  been 
identified in multiple ST744 isolates from both pig and gull isolates from the APHA ARDIG farm. The 
student is also including the ST744 isolates from other ARDIG partners and online databases to identify 
how prevalent this transposon is and how it may be expanding and contracting regarding the AMR genes 
it carries. 
 
This  work  has  not  been  started  yet  regarding  the  cross-sectional  farm  visit  isolates  as  it  requires 
completion of Milestone 2. This work is still ongoing.

3.  Progress of the research project: milestones and deliverables 
The following list refers to the deliverables and milestones as mentioned in the successive project Annual 
Work Plans. This part of the report demonstrates the progress that the project has made in Y5. 
WP6 Team has pre-filled this table with available information. Please verify, correct if needed, complete, and 
make sure that all deliverables are uploaded both on the private project group of the One Health EJP website 
and on Zenodo.  
Note that all deliverables should be public. In case of a scientific manuscript, be it the manuscript itself or 
the data supporting it, which cannot be publicized yet, you should upload a document that describes the 
work done (sampling, analysis, more or less the detail of the results, conclusions of the work, etc.). The 
author of this document chooses the detail, which needs to be sufficiently clear for an external reader to 
assess the work done. This will especially be of importance at the end of the project when the project and 
its deliverables will be assessed by external reviewers.
