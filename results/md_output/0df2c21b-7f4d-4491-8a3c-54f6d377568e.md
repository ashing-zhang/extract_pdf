1.2 SOP Summary 
 
Title  
 
 
Cultivation experiments of Hungarian Legume Land Races 
 
 
Brief description  
 
 
The  aim  of  the  experiment  to  test  legume  land  races  at  different  small-scale  farming 
locations  either  in  organic  and  fully  chemical-free  cultivation  for  3  years.  Cultivation 
technology is mostly standardised. Data is gathered following a specially designed protocol 
based on the on-farm protocol of the Hungarian Institute for Organic Agriculture (ÖMKI).  
 
The technological description and protocol consists of three parts: 
 
1.  Species-specific cultivation technology proposal 
2.  Protocol  (template)  for  observation  data  regarding  organic,  small-scale 
cultivation 
3.  Protocol (template) for observation data regarding potential use

2 Protocol Steps  
 
Designing and conducting organic cultivation experiments of legume land 
races 
 
1.  Assessment of agro-ecological conditions of the cultivation location. 
To describe the specific agro-ecological parameters of the plot(s) in question (soil, water, 
temperature, etc.) 
 
2.  Planting legume land races using technological descriptions 
Collect facts and figures of plantation: timing, soil temperature, distance of seed(s), support 
system if needed, preparation for most frequent possible pests and diseases (pheromone-
traps, etc.) 
 
3.  Repeated  data  gathering  on  cultivation  process  (general  observations  during 
cultivation) 
Objective observation data:  
-  Planting (previous crop, seed distance, fertiliser) 
-  Germination (timing, density, frequency of sprouts) 
-  Used technology (watering, other) 
-  Flowering (start-70%-end) 
-  Pests and diseases observed 
-  Plant physiognomy (height, behaviour) 
-  Other observations 
 
Subjective observation data:  
-  How much are you generally satisfied with the crop (as a producer)? 
-  Would you plant it again (having the experiment completed)? 
 
4.  Data gathering with a focus on crops (different stages) and their possible use.  
Green pods 
-  Appearance of first pods (timing) 
-  Appearance of all (most) pods 
-  Physiognomy of pods – colour, length, height, width, other 
-  Timing of harvest 
-  Yield 
 
Fresh and/or dry beans 
- Shape of seeds 
- Colour/pattern of seeds
