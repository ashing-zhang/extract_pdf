Brief description  
 
 
Ascorbate (AsA) is a major antioxidant and free-radical scavenger in plants and is considered 
to be of paramount importance as an electron donor for H O  detoxifications via ascorbate

Antioxidant assay 1: Ascorbate 
 
peroxidase (APX) 
 
 
 
 
 
2 Protocol Steps  
 
1st stage: Enzyme Extraction 
0.1 g of each pulverized, frozen sample (leaf and root samples) was homogenised with ice-cold 
25 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.8). The HEPES buffer contained 0.2 mM EDTA, 2 mM ascorbate and 2 % 
(w/v) polyvinylpyrolidon (PVP). The homogenates were centrifuged at 4 °C and 14,000 rpm. The 
supernatants obtained were used for enzyme analysis. The procedure for enzyme extraction was 
carried out at 0-4 oC.  
 
Reagents 
 
To prepare 1 L of the necessary reagents, the following equation was used: 
 
                                                                            m = C * V * M                                            (equation 1) 
 
with    m = weight (g) 
           C = molarity (mol/L) 
           V = volume to be prepared (L) 
           MB = molecular weight (g/mol) 
 
 
•  25 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.8)  
Weigh 5.9575 g of HEPES (MB = 238.30) in a 1 L volumetric flask and adjust to 1 L with H O (m 
2
= 0.025 * 1 * 238.30). Adjust the pH to 7.8 using either an HCl or NaOH solution. 
 
•  0.2 mM EDTA 
Weigh 0.0745 g of EDTA (MB = 372.24) in a 1 L volumetric flask and adjust to 1 L with H O (m = 
2
0.0002 * 1 * 372.24). 
 
•  2 mM ascorbate (AsA)  
 
Weigh 0.352 g of Ascorbate (MB = 176.12) in a 1 L volumetric flask and adjust to 1 L with H O 
2
(m = 0.002 * 1 * 176.12). 
 
•  2% (W/V) polyvinylpyrolidon PVP 
▪  2 g in 100 mL

Antioxidant assay 1: Ascorbate 
 
peroxidase (APX) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2nd stage: Measuring Ascorbate peroxidase 
 
The ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activity was measured in the leaf-samples in accordance to the 
method of Nakano and Asada (1981), with a few modifications due to ascorbate oxidation and 
therefore the decrease in absorbance at 290 nm . 
 
200 μL of reaction mixture containing 25 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 0.5 mM 
ascorbate, 0.1 mM EDTA and 0.1 mM hydrogen peroxide and 10 μL plant extract were used. The 
reaction was started by adding the hydrogen peroxide and the absorbance at 290 nm was measured 
over  five  minutes  (7-14  minutes  better)  with  the  Synergy  HT  96-  position  microplate 
spectrophotometer  (Biotek,  Winooski,  USA).  The  absorbance  of  the  mixture  before  hydrogen 
peroxide was added served as blank. To transfer the data in an excel format, the programme KC4 
was used. For the calculation of APX-activity the absorbance coefficient of reduced ascorbate (E = 
2.8 mM*cm-1) was used (Nakano and Asada, 1981).  
 
Reagents for the preparation of the reaction mixture: 
 
•  25 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0)  
1M K HPO  
2 4
Since the molar mass of K HPO  is 174.1760 g/mol, a 1 M solution would be 174.1760 g in 1L.  
2 4
1M KH PO  
2 4
Since the molar mass of KH PO  is 136.0857 g/mol, a 1 M solution would be 136.0857 g in 1L.  
2 4
Preparation of 1L of 0.1 M = 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer at 25 °C 
Desired pH  Volume of 1M K HPO  (mL)  Volume of 1M KH PO  (mL) 
2 4 2 4
7.0  61.5  38.5 
Hence, for the preparation of 100 mL of 0.025 M = 25 mM potassium phosphate buffer at 25 °C 
 Desired pH  Volume of 1M K HPO  (mL)  Volume of 1M KH PO  (mL) 
2 4 2 4
7.0  1.5375  0.9625 
 
•  0.5 mM ascorbate  
To prepare 100 mL of a 0.5 mM solution of ascorbate, use 8.806 mg of Ascorbate (MB = 176.12) 
(m = 0.0005 * 100 * 176.12 from equation 1). 
 
•  0.1 mM H O  
2 2
First determine the molarity (C) of your commercial H O  solution (mol/g).

Using the equation 2 below:  
 
C = (m/MB) * V                                             (equation 2) 
 
with     m = weight (g) = D * % solution 
            MB = Molecular weight (g/mol) 
            V = Volume (L) 
 
The molarity of a 30% solution of H O can be calculated using: 
2 2 
 
C = (D * % solution) / MB * 1,000                          (equation 3) 
 
MB = 34.01    
% of solution = 30  
Density = 1.1 g/cm3 = 1,100 g/L  
 
Hence the molarity of 30 % solution of H O  is 9.79 M or 9,790 mM (1.1 * 30/100) /34.01 *1,000). 
2 2
 
To prepare 1 L of a 0.1 mM solution, use the following equation: 
  
C1V1 = C2V2  
with   C1 = 9,790 mM 
          C2 = 0.1 mM 
          V2 = 1,000 mL 
V1 = 0.1*1,000/9,790= 0.0102 mL 
 
Similarly, to prepare a 100 mL of a 10 mM solution, use 0.102 mL of your H O  commercial solution 
2 2
(V1 = 10*100/9.790) 
Then  prepare  a  diluted  solution  of  0.1  mM  (1  mL  of  10  mM  into  100  mL  H O)

3rd stage: Calculations 
 
First with the absorbance measured, calculate the C using equation 4: 
 
C= ΔΑ/ (ε*d) = ΔΑ / [2.8 *103 * d]                            (equation 4) 
 
 
with    C = molarity of ascorbate (mol/L)  
ΔΑ = Absorption Difference  
 e = Extinction absorbance coefficient of reduced ascorbate: 
▪  (ε = 2.8 mM*cm-1 = 2.8 *103 L/mol*cm) 
 D = Light path (cm) (0.1 cm plastic plate, 0.2 cm glass plate) 
 
To calculate the ascorbate peroxidase activity, use equation 5 below: 
 
U (mol/g/min) = (V * C)/ (Δt * FM)                       (equation 5) 
 
 
with     U = Activity (mol min-1 gr -1)) 
V = Assay volume (L) 
Δt = t1- t0 = (time between measurements) (min) 
FM = weight of the fresh material (g)  
 
Or by substituting C in equation 5 for equation 4: 
 
U = (V * C)/ (Δt * FM) = [V (L) *C]/ [Δt * FM] 
 
From this, you can also calculate the ascorbate peroxidase activity per protein (U’) by dividing U by 
the protein content in grams (Equation 6).  
 
U΄ (mol gr-1 protein min-1] = U/ Protein content (g)1           (equation 6)
