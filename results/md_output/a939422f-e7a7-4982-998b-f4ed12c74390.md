General Introduction 
●  Description of the role experimental phase within the ALL 
●  Description of the steps taken so far and main outcomes of activities that affect the design 
of the experimental phase 
●  Main challenges selected with link to reports from workshop 1 
●  AEPs prioritized for field evaluation with link to reports from workshop 2 
●  Link  
●  Description of the process and rationale for the design of the experimental phase. This is 
important for communication and transparency among stakeholders. For example: 
After the  workshops  in  which  the  most  relevant  AEPs  to evaluate  in  the  field  were  selected  by 
stakeholders, researchers had a series of meetings and a field visit to define the experimental phase 
for the first cycle of co-creation. The main considerations for the selection of AEP to evaluate, and on 
the experimental design were: 
 
In the meetings, researchers had after the co-creation process was concluded alternative trials were 
discussed. It was decided that for the first cycle of the experimental phase, we would concentrate 
resources on NNN crop. We designed a trial that can ensure results that can align with the 3 aspects 
mentioned above while building the ALL as a sustainable platform. In the following cycles, with 

lessons learned from the first experiment, we can plan more complex designs and more crops of 
interest, such as NNN and NNN.

Rationale
Rational behind the AEP selected. Why are they important and why should we use the limited 
resources of the ALL to test them in the field. 
Expected outcomes for stakeholders 
It is very important that the expected outcomes for each stakeholder in the ALL are realistic and 
clear. They should match with the amount of efforts and resources that each stakeholder brings 
into the ALL and with focus on the sustainability of the platform. In the initial year(s), focus should 
be on farmers are their commitment and engagement on the activities are key. Outcomes from 
the first cycle of co-cereation should bring something tangible, useful for the farmers. That could 
be a possible solution to their challenges (e.g., a biopesticide for a key pest that can be produced 
locally from locally available and abundant plants), a response to an important question (e.g., is 
the foliar fertilizer that most farmers are using profitable?) or to show the value that the platform 
has for them in the longer term (results from the trial do not bring immediate responses or 
solutions but proof the value of the work done and create engagement from farmers), or others.

Training, meetings, field visits, and workshops 
Key aspects of the experimental phase are the training for the farmers participating of the trial, the field 
visits and meetings to discuss and disseminate the results and the activities of the ALL and the final 
workshop that is the step N 4 on the co-creation process.
