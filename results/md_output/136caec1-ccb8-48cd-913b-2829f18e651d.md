Abstract 
The majority, if not all, of the equipment in our homes and apartments can be powered by solar energy. 
Solar energy is a renewable resource. Other factors that make using solar energy so important in 
Nigeria include the country's climate, which is suitable for solar energy use, inconsistent electricity 
supply, delayed electricity supply projects for rural areas, etc. Designing, selecting, and figuring out 
the equipment ratings for a photovoltaic system is therefore important. The methods used to choose 
the  different components  of  a  stand-alone  photovoltaic  system  were  examined  in  this  paper.  The 
method was chosen to be applied to a typical Nigerian household in a highbrow neighbourhood. For 
the  solar  PV  array,  battery  bank,  voltage  controller,  and  inverter  to  meet  the  design  goals, 
measurements were taken and suitable brands were suggested. The household under consideration 
required 128 Poly-Luminous solar panels (250 Watts, 24 V, 8.31 A); 22 LiFePO4 batteries (48 V, 400 
Ah,  High  Capacity,  20  KWH Energy  Storage Battery);  5  ConextTM  MPPT  60  150  solar  charge 
controllers; and 1 Mercury 11 KVA Solar Hybrid Inverter in order to supply 82.3875 kWh/d of solar 
power to the household. The variables that influence the selection of each piece of equipment employed 
in  the  system's  design  and  size  were  also  discussed.  Oversizing  and  undersizing  of  any  piece  of 
equipment were avoided to guarantee appropriate system design. Applications with higher or lower 
energy consumption as well as those in different regions can employ the same approach, which could 
be modified accordingly. Nonetheless, the design should adhere to these environmental parameters of 
these areas. 
 
1.0 Introduction 
The energy needed to keep life in our solar system going comes from the sun. The sun provides 
the planet with enough energy each day to meet its needs (World Energy Council, 2013; Pourasl 
et al., 2023). The direct conversion of sunlight into power is known as photovoltaic. For a variety

of reasons, it is a desirable substitute for traditional electricity sources: it is dependable with low 
failure rates and anticipated service lifetimes of 20 to 30 years; it is also safe, silent, and non-
polluting; it is renewable; and it is highly modular in that its capacity can be increased gradually 
to match with gradual load growth (Kurpaska et al., 2018). It has no moving parts, is incredibly 
dependable and practically maintenance free, can be installed practically anyplace, and doesn't 
require any specialised training to operate. The amount of sunlight that reaches the planet varies 
depending on the season, location, weather, and time of day. Irradiation, measured in Wh.m-2 per 
day or, for example, kWh.m-2 per day, is the total energy on a daily or annual basis that represents 
the intensity of the sun (Ibrahim et al., 2019).  
 
The location of our home has a significant impact on the design of a photovoltaic system from 
several angles, including panel orientation, calculating the number of days during the year when 
the sun doesn't shine, and selecting the optimal tilt angle for the solar panels. This is because 
different geographic regions have different weather patterns. Installing photovoltaic panels atop a 
tracker that tracks the sun's movement increases energy collection, but it is a costly procedure. 
They often have a fixed location with an angle known as the tilt angle β because of this. Seasonal 
fluctuations are reflected in this angle (Posadillo and Luque, 2008). For example, the solar panel 
needs to be positioned more horizontally in the summer and at a steeper angle in the winter.  
Nigeria is one of the biggest countries in West Africa, home to an estimated 227.713 million people 
(2024 estimate). With a GDP of over $477 billion, it is ranked first in Africa and thirty-one in the 
world (O'Neill, 2023). In addition to enhancing the country's current infrastructure, Nigeria has to 
develop solar and renewable energy sources in order to maintain economic growth, meet SDG7 
targets, and raise the standard of living for its people.  
 
Nigeria's  energy  grid  still  faces  significant  difficulties,  despite  the  country  having  produced 
electricity since 1896. System instability, regular outages, and constant fluctuations characterise 
the grid supply. When it comes to generation, the prevalent traditional fossil fuel sources are 
impacted by a number of factors, including devaluation, inflation, and fluctuations in exchange 
rates; operational difficulties in the electricity sector, such as insufficient generation capacity to 
fulfil the nation's demand; and the requirement to recoup related costs. The transmission and 
distribution (T&D) sub-sectors have seen significant power losses due to antiquated and subpar 
infrastructure, which exacerbates the problems and cools the enthusiasm of the public and private 
sectors  for  additional  capacity  investment.  Currently  ranked  as  the  25th  largest  emitter  of 
greenhouse gases, the government faces pressure from both local and international sources to 
reduce carbon emissions. This has created an urgency to find new and environmentally friendly 
ways to conduct structural development and alter the energy supply.  
 
It is encouraging that in Nigeria, a country with an abundance of natural resources, renewable 
energy technologies, which are characterised by their declining costs, simple deployment, and 
rising capacities for enhanced resilience, have grown by double digits in recent years. These energy 
sources not only increase the nation's electricity capacity but also have some beneficial effects on 
its  climate  initiatives.  These  outcomes  are  essentially  the  direct  result  of  the  government's 
implementation of several renewable energy programmes and incentives.  
 
Nigeria's  geographic  location  makes  it  a  particularly  appealing  place  to  install  solar-powered 
equipment. Due to the established advantages of this energy source, there is a strong inclination

for the deployment of standalone photovoltaic stations scattered over rural places. For the benefit 
of the residents in these locations, this topic needs to be specified. The methods used to design and 
choose the components of a standalone photovoltaic system depending on Watt-Hour requirement 
are introduced by the author in this study. Additionally, all of the elements that influence the size 
and design of each piece of equipment in the system have been listed. In order to guarantee an 
adequate, dependable, and cost-effective system design, oversizing and undersizing have also been 
avoided. The same techniques could be used and modified for applications requiring higher energy 
consumptions, as well as for various geographic areas; although, these places' specific design 
characteristics should be used.  
 
There is now less than 4GW of energy generation capacity due to the status of the electrical market 
(Adoghe et al., 2023; Trade, 2023; International Trade Administration, 2023). In metropolitan 
regions, the rate of electricity is 55%, whereas in rural settlements, it is 35% (International Trade 
Administration, 2023). This is taken to indicate that approximately 100 million people, or a large 
fraction of the population, do not have access to power. In addition, the country's deplorable grid 
system has made it necessary to increase the amount of power generated by fossil fuel generators. 
Due to this expansion, air pollution from generators has increased, endangering human health and 
the environment.  
 
Nevertheless,  because  of  its  advantageous  location  on  the  equator,  the  nation  receives  an 
abundance of solar resources despite the precarious situation of electricity. This solar resource is 
dispersed throughout the nation. Table 1 shows the amount of solar radiation that each country's 
zones get. According to estimates, the yearly daily average of total solar radiation in Nigeria's 
coastal region is between 12.6 and 3.5 MJ/m2/day (or 3.5 kWh/m2/day), and between 25.2 and 7.0 
MJ/m2/day (or 7.0 kWh/m2/day) in the northern region (Adun et al., 2022). With lines pointing to 
the states in the region that are under consideration, Figure 1 depicts the solar radiation for the 
various regions of Nigeria.

The  process  for  designing  standalone  PV  systems  was  presented  by  numerous  researchers 
(Aderamola, 2014, Dioha et al., 2018; Olarewaju et al., 2020). This study aims to present the 
methods used in the construction and equipment selection of a standalone solar system according 
to Watt-Hour demand.

2.0 System Description 
 
2.1 Components of a Stand-alone PV System 
An autonomous solar system that generates electricity to charge battery banks during the day so 
they may be used at night when the sun is not shining is known as a basic standalone photovoltaic 
system. Rechargeable batteries are used in standalone small-scale photovoltaic systems to store 
the  electrical  energy  produced  by  photovoltaic  panels  or  arrays.  A  collection  of  separate 
photovoltaic modules, also known as panels, with power outputs ranging from 50 to more than 
100 watts apiece, typically operating at 12 volts, make up an off-grid or standalone PV system. 
The required power output is then obtained by combining these PV modules into a single array. 
Figure shows a stand-alone photovoltaic system.  
 
In situations where, using other power sources to operate appliances, lights, and other devices is 
either impractical or not possible, standalone photovoltaic systems are the best option for isolated

rural locations. In certain situations, installing a single standalone PV system is more economical 
than paying the local power company to extend their power lines and cables straight to the house 
as part of a grid-connected PV system.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2. Stand-alone PV System (Alternative Energy Tutorials, 2024)  
The  solar  array  is  the  main  component  and  most  expensive  part  of a  standalone  PV  system, 
however there are usually a few more parts that are required. Among them are:  
 
1. Photovoltaic module: This semiconductor-based device turns sunshine into electricity. Sunlight 
is  converted  into  DC  electricity  by  the  PV.  As  new  technologies  reach  the  market,  single, 
polycrystalline, and amorphous silicon are the most widely used materials in PV modules.  
 
2. Batteries: Depending on the design, batteries may be a required component or an optional add-
on  for  any  standalone  photovoltaic  system.  The  electricity  generated  by  the  sun  is  stored  in 
batteries for use at night or in an emergency during the day. Battery banks can have a total capacity 
of many hundreds of amperes and a voltage of 12V, 24V, or 48V, depending on how the solar 
array is configured.

various Nigerian locations: by Mumah S. N., Nwafulugo F.U., and Akande H. F. 
 
3. Charge Controller: A charge controller dissipates excess power into a load resistance in order 
to regulate and control the output from the solar array and prevent the batteries from being over-
charged or over-discharged. Although they are not required in a standalone PV system, charge 
controllers are a good idea for safety reasons.  
 
4. Fuses and Isolation Switches: These devices guard PV installations against unintentional wire 
shorting and enable the PV modules and system to be turned "OFF" when not in use, conserving 
energy and extending battery life.  
 
5. Inverter: In a stand-alone system, an additional optional component is the inverter. The 12V, 
24V, or 48V direct current (DC) power from the solar array and batteries is converted by inverters 
into 120 VAC or 240 VAC AC electricity and power for use in the home to power AC major 
appliances like TVs, washers, refrigerators, and so forth.  
 
6. Electrical wiring is the last component needed for a photovoltaic solar system. For the needed 
voltage and power, the cables must be appropriately rated. Bell or phone cable that is too thin are 
not recommended. 
 
The various parts of a solar PV system should be chosen based on the uses, site location, and 
system type. A balance-of-system made comprised of the following parts that when connected 
together, create a fully operational system that can supply electricity:  
 
2.2 Configuration of power electronic interfaces for stand-alone PV systems 
A storage device and its controller enable the stand-alone PV systems to sustainably meet the load 
power demands. When the power available from the PV panel is less than the required power at 
the load bus, the storage device with the controller should supply the power difference. The PV 
panel should supply the load power and use the extra power to charge the storage device when the 
PV panel's available power exceeds the required power. Figure 3 depicts a basic PV panel/battery 
connection configuration.

3.0 System sizing 
System sizing is the process of determining which photovoltaic system component has the proper 
voltage and current ratings to meet the facility's electricity needs while also figuring out the total 
cost of the system, including labour and shipping, from the design stage to the finished product.

3.1. Residence Device 
The amount of energy that your appliances utilise must be known in order to determine the load in 
your home. For the majority of ordinary appliances and lighting, air conditioning is usually not 
necessary, although in tropical climates it might be. The energy consumption numbers for the 
majority of appliances and lighting are rather close to those indicated in Table 2. To determine the 
average energy consumption in Watt-hour per day, Table 3 below lists the electrical devices that 
are available at the residence along with their power ratings and times of operation throughout the 
day. The equipment sizes and ratings, beginning with the solar array and concluding with the 
system wiring and cost estimate as detailed below, are determined by taking the whole average 
energy usage into consideration.

Other factors that affect the annual power usage are as follows:  
a.  Number of household members: a higher number of household members means more time is 
spent cooking, more laundry is done, larger refrigerators, etc. Additionally, because homes are 
often larger, they will use more energy for air conditioning and heating.

b.  Features of the dwelling: well insulated houses require less energy to keep the temperature at 
the right level. Less electric lighting will be required if the windows' orientation and type allow 
for greater light.  
c.  Lifestyle:  As  we  have  previously  stated  several  times,  lifestyle  plays  a  major  role  in 
determining annual power consumption. Making every effort to maximise efficiency can help 
you actively cut back on energy use. This entails managing appliance use, avoiding standby, 
selecting energy-efficient appliances, and selecting energy-efficient programmes.  
 
3.2 Solar Panel Needs 
Demands for solar panels are determined by three primary factors. Production Ratio, Total Solar 
Panel Wattage, and Annual Energy Consumption are the three. Kilowatt-hours (kWh) are used to 
measure the amount of energy that a residence uses in a calendar year, or the total amount of energy 
used by all appliances and gadgets that need to be powered. While they offer the most power, 
premium solar panels are only a good fit for certain types of homes. A solar panel system should 
be chosen with the output in mind, as it is designed to meet your entire electrical needs. The power 
rating, or panel wattage, tells you how much electricity the panel can generate under perfect 
circumstances. According to Diemuodeke (2021) the majority of solar panels have an output of 
250–450 watts (W). More electricity is produced by a panel with a higher wattage. A project's 
requirement for solar panels will be decreased if a high wattage is used. Higher-wattage solar 
panels are an option for homeowners looking to meet 100% of their energy needs (Diemuodeke, 
2021). Lower-wattage panels make more sense if there are fewer energy requirements or if a partial 
conversion system is being explored.  
 
The process of calculating the production ratio of a solar power system involves comparing the 
overall wattage of the system to its predicted power generation over time. It is challenging to 
determine this ratio precisely because the amount of sunlight your panels receive varies every day. 
However, by dividing the estimated annual production by the size of the system, you can get a 
rough idea.  
 
The production ratio describes how much electricity your solar panel generates in your location 
under typical sunlight and weather conditions. The process of calculating the production ratio of a 
solar power system involves comparing the overall wattage of the system to its predicted power 
generation over time. It is challenging to determine this ratio precisely because the amount of 
sunlight  your  panels  receive  varies  every  day.  However,  by  dividing  the  estimated  annual 
production by the size of the system, you can get a rough idea. Production ratios in Nigeria vary 
from  one  to  1.6,  depending  on  the  location.  for a  system  generating  10  kW  and  15  kWh  of 
electricity each year. 15 / 10 = 1.5 is the production ratio for this solar energy system. This scenario 
is applicable to residences in places like Kaduna that receive a lot of sunshine during the day. The 
output ratio could fall to 1.2 if you reside in a place like Lagos or Port Harcourt where clouds are 
common. Similarly, this is true for areas that are usually cloudy due to Saharan dust. According to 
Dioha and Kumar (2018), production ratios in the range of 1.0 to 1.3 are therefore anticipated for 
places like Sokoto and Maiduguri.  
 
3.3. Sizing of the solar PV array 
Prior to sizing the array, it is necessary to calculate the system's DC voltage (VDC), average daily 
solar hour (T ), and total daily energy in Watt-hours (E). After these variables are available, we

proceed to the sizing procedure. Losses must be taken into account in order to prevent undersizing. 
To calculate the required energy E , divide the total power demand in Wh.day-1 by the product of 
r
the efficiency of all system components.  
 
In order to prevent undersizing, we calculate the daily energy required from the solar array by first 
dividing the overall average daily energy demand by the system component efficiencies (Japan 
International Cooperation Agency, June 2010; Al-Shamani, 2015):

The previous value is divided by the average number of sun hours per day for the given location

3.4. Sizing of the battery bank 
The total power demand multiplied by the number of autonomy days determines the amount of 
approximate energy storage needed. The percentage of the battery that has been depleted in 
relation to its overall capacity is known as the depth of discharge. A solar battery with an 8 kWh 
capacity, for instance, would have a 75% depth of discharge if you were to drain 6 kWh from it.

The rated voltage of each battery Vb that will be utilised in the battery bank must be decided at 
this time. One way to calculate the battery bank's required capacity in ampere-hours is to divide 
the safe energy storage requirement by the DC voltage of one of the chosen batteries:

Another choice must be made for the capacity C  of each battery in the battery bank based on the 
b
number acquired for the bank's capacity. Batteries make up the battery bank. By dividing the

3.5. Sizing of the voltage controller 
The lifetime and efficiency of your complete battery-based photovoltaic (PV) system depend on 
the choice of an effective and well-designed charge controller. You can go closer to offsetting your 
use of traditional grid power or another source of energy by making the most out of the power that 
your solar modules generate. Additionally, by safeguarding your battery bank, you'll be shielding 
yourself from unanticipated and unnecessary replacement expenses. Current levels can rise due to

a few things, like light reflection or the sporadic cloud effect. This happens frequently. As a result, 
we add a 25%–30% cushion to the charge controller amperage.  
 
It  regulates  the  flow  of  current  in  accordance  with  its  function.  Both  the  maximum  current 
generated by the array and the maximum load current must be supported by a reliable voltage 
regulator. By multiplying the short circuit current of the modules connected in parallel by a safety 
factor F , the voltage regulator's size can be determined. The voltage regulator's rated current is

In order to ensure that the regulator can manage the maximum current generated by the array, 
which may exceed the tabulated value, the safety factor is utilised. Additionally, in the event that 
equipment is added and the load current exceeds the planned amount. Stated differently, this safety 
factor permits a small system expansion.  
 
The array short current amps divided by the amps for each controller determines the number of 
controllers.

The select panel is Luminous (240W, 24V, 8.85 A). The following procedure can be used to 
calculate the solar array's daily energy requirement. First, the entire Watt-peak rating required for 
photovoltaic modules is computed. The PV modules' total daily Watt-hour need is split by the 
panel generation factor. The panel generation factor for the locations is calculated to be 3.625.

4.4. Sizing of the Voltage Controller: 
Usually, the solar charge controller is rated based on its voltage and amperage capacity. After 
determining  which  solar  charge  controller  type  is  best  for  your  application,  choose  one  that 
matches the voltage of the PV array and batteries. Verify the solar charge controller's capabilities 
to manage the PV array's current.  The total PV input current that is supplied to the series charge 
controller type controller determines its size, as does the arrangement of the PV panels (series or 
parallel). It is normal procedure to multiply the PV array's short circuit current (Isc) by 1.3 in order 
to determine the size of the solar charge controller.  
 
Solar charge controller rating = Total short circuit current of PV array x 1.3 
 
Conext™ MPPT 60 150 solar charge controller is selected as the controller. The specifications are 
presented on Table 6.

4.5. Sizing of the Inverter: 
In systems that require AC power output, an inverter is employed. The overall wattage of the 
appliances should always exceed the input rating of the inverter. Your battery's nominal voltage 
and the inverter's voltage must match. The inverter for standalone systems needs to be big enough 
to manage all the Watts you'll be utilising at once. The inverter's size should be 25–30% larger

than the appliances' combined wattage. If the type of appliance is a motor or compressor, the 
inverter size needs to be at least three times the capacity of those appliances. Additionally, the 
inverter capacity needs to be increased in order to withstand surge current at startup. To ensure 
safe and effective operation, the input rating of the inverter for grid tie or grid connected systems 
must match the rating of the PV array.

5.0 Conclusion 
Nigeria is one of the biggest countries in West Africa, home to about 213 million people. With a 
GDP of about $477 billion, it is ranked 31st globally and first in Africa. In addition to enhancing 
the country's current infrastructure, Nigeria has to develop solar and renewable energy sources in 
order to maintain economic growth, meet SDG7 targets, and raise the standard of living for its 
people. The methods used to choose the various components of a standalone photovoltaic system 
have  been  examined  in  this  study.  The  technique  will  be  implemented  in  a  typical  Nigerian 
household located in a posh neighbourhood. In order to attain the design's goals, the sizes of the 
solar PV array, battery bank, voltage controller, and inverter have been determined in this paper, 
along with the suggested brands. for the home under consideration. According to the design, in 
order to supply solar electricity to the household, 128 Poly Luminous solar panels (250 Watts, 24 
V, 8.31 A), 22 LiFePO4 batteries (48 V, 400 Ah, High Capacity, 20 KWH Energy Storage Battery), 
5 ConextTM MPPT 60 150 solar charge controllers, and 1 Mercury 11 KVA Solar Hybrid Inverter 
are required.  
 
Additionally, all of the elements that influence the size and design of each piece of equipment in 
the system have been listed. When sizing every piece of equipment In  order to guarantee an 
adequate, dependable, and cost-effective system design, oversizing and undersizing have also been 
avoided. The same techniques might be used, modified for applications with different energy 
consumption levels, and applied to different regions. Nonetheless, the design ought to take into 
account the relevant design constraints of these sites.
