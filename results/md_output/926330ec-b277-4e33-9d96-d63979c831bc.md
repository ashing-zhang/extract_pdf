I.  Nomenclature 
Following the majority of studies, we use the term RET to describe the most general 
mechanism  of  resonant  energy  transfer  between  excited  donor  and  ground  state 
acceptor.  In  this  sense,  the  RET  term  does  not  distinguish  between  various 
mechanisms  leading  to  e.g. intersystem  crossing,  sensitized  up  conversion,  or 
conventional Stokes excitation. Neither does it consider any specific types or features 
of D or A species, which can be individual molecule, individual quantum dot donors, or 
multiple donor ion doped nanoparticles. The term FRET is used in its conventional 
sense to specifically describe RET involving conventional molecular D and A species, 
while the LRET will be used to discuss RET involving luminescent lanthanide ions as 
donors, either from molecular lanthanide complexes or lanthanide doped nanoparticles. 
To consider the up conversion as the photoexcitation mechanism proceeding RET 
between excited states of multiple lanthanide ions within single donor nanoparticles 
and multiple acceptor molecules anchored to the surface of such donor nanoparticle, 
we  adopt  the  term  UC-LRET.  In  particular,  the  UC-LRET  with  upconverting 
nanoparticles involves discussion of the energy-transfer upconversion (ETU), energy 
migration  (EM),  and  back  energy  transfer  (BET).  All  of  them  could  influence  the 
excitation of the upconverted, resonant state of the donor-activator ions in the UCNPs 
and potential rapid ‘recharging’ of the actual donor ions relaxed upon UC-LRET. In 
some  cases,  the  effect  of  sensitization  is  common  using  antenna  dye-sensitized 
downshifting or sensitizer-ETU-based upconverting lanthanide donors. In both cases, 
the QY of the donor related to RET is the internal QY of the donor that does not include 
the efficiency of the sensitization path. Thus, the existence of energy transfer steps in 
the donor excitation pathway does not alone fundamentally differentiate Eu-chelate 
and  UCNP  donor  based  RET  1.  However,  with  Ln3+  as  a  donor,  photoexcitation 
pathway is far more complex, and each UCNP is composed of thousands or tens of 
thousands of actual Er3+ donor ions and sensitizing Yb3+ . The features that make the 
UC-LRET were discussed here, to be so unique in behavior.

II.B. Theoretical emission and absorption for donor and acceptor  
To estimate the spectral overlap between D and A required for the LRET mechanism, 
we provided a theoretical calculation based on the absorption cross-section of Er3+, 
the literature value of molar extinction for Rose Bengal (RB) dye (that allow to estimate 
the intensity of the sensitized acceptor emission), and also the emission spectrum. 
Only 2H  (at 520 nm) and 4S  (at 540 nm) emission overlaps with the absorption 
11/2 3/2
bands of RB. Energy levels for Er3+ lanthanides ions are shown in Figure 1 and were 
analyzed  theoretically  with  Judd  Ofelt  theory  and  differential  rate  equation,  and 
experimentally  with  emission  spectra.  Molar  extinction  coefficient  (M-1 cm-1)  of  RB 
gives information on how dye absorbs light at each wavelength. The spectral overlap 
for Er3+ ion emission and RB absorption spectrum fulfills the requirements for RET 
mechanism. In our system, we photoexcite Yb3+ ions with 980 nm laser wavelength, 
which is far from absorption of the acceptor (RB) in the studied resonance energy 
transfer scheme, so we can disregard residual A photoexcitation and focus on 𝐷-𝐴 
RET mechanism.

III.  Materials and methods 
Materials  
Yttrium oxide (99.99 %), ytterbium oxide (99.99 %), and erbium oxide (99.99 %) were 
purchased from Alfa Aesar. Dry DMF (99.8 %), nitrosonium tetrafluoroborate (95 %), 
Rose Bengal (95 % dye content), oleic acid (OA, 90 %), and 1-octadecene (ODE, 90 %) 
were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Acetic acid (99.5 - 99.9 %), ethanol (96 %), n-
hexane  (95 %),  methanol  (99.8 %),  ammonium  fluoride  (98 %),  toluene  (99,5 %), 
acetonitrile and sodium hydroxide (98.8 %) were purchased from Avantor Performance 
Materials S.A. (Poland). All chemical reagents were used without further purification. 
The  materials  were  synthesized  according  to  the  method  described  in  previous 
publications 6,7.  
Preparation of precursor 
The precursor was generally prepared by mixing stoichiometric amounts of lanthanide 
oxides (Y O , Yb O , Er O —1 × 10−3 M) with 50 % aqueous acetic acid and heating 
2 3 2 3 2 3
the mixture to 200 °C for 120 min under pressure. The final precursor was obtained by 
evaporating residual acid and water in a rotary evaporator, and further drying at 130 °C 
for 12 h.  
 
Synthesis of upconverting nanoparticles 
Preparation  of  Core  and  Core@Shell  Material:  In  a  typical  synthesis,  the  given 
amounts (2 × 10−3 mol Ln3+) of (CH COO) Ln precursors were added to the three-neck 
3 3
flask with OA (12 cm3) and ODE (30 cm3). The solution was stirred under a nitrogen 
atmosphere and heated slowly to 140 °C, followed by degassing under a vacuum for 
30 min to remove oxygen and water. After evaporation of residual water, the nitrogen 
atmosphere was maintained during the synthesis. Then, the reaction temperature was 
decreased to 50 °C, and during this time, solutions of ammonium fluoride and sodium 
hydroxide  dissolved  in  methanol  were added.  The  reaction mixture  was  stirred  for 
30 min at 50 °C. Then, the temperature was increased to 80 °C, and the mixture was 
kept at this temperature for 30 min to evaporate methanol. After that, the reaction 
temperature was increased quickly to 300 °C and kept at this temperature for 60 min 
under a nitrogen atmosphere. After the UCNPs formation, the mixture was allowed to 
cool to room temperature. The UCNPs were precipitated by the addition of ethanol and 
isolated by centrifugation at 10 000 rpm for 10 minutes. For purification, the resulting 
pellet was dispersed in a minimal amount of  n-hexane and again precipitated with 
excess ethanol.  The  final  product  was  isolated by  centrifugation at  14 000 rpm for 
10 min and dispersed in 12 cm3 n-hexane. For the synthesis of core @ shell UCNPs, 
the  following  changes  in  the  reaction procedure  were  introduced.  After  initial  shell 
precursor mixing and dissolving in OA and ODE at 140 °C, the mixture was cooled to 
80 °C,  and  the  solution  of  core  UCNPs  was  added.  The  reaction  solution  was 
maintained at 80 °C to remove n-hexane. Then, the temperature was lowered to 50 °C, 
and methanolic solutions of ammonium fluoride (8 × 10−3 mol) and sodium hydroxide 
(5 × 10−3 mol) were added. The next steps of the synthesis were analogous to the 
previously  described  procedure  used  for  core  synthesis.  Finally,  the  UCNPs  were 
precipitated and centrifuged using the same procedure mentioned above. The final 
product stabilized with OA ligands was dispersed in 5 cm3 of chloroform (CHCl ).

Removal the oleic acid 
To remove the oleic acid ligands from the surface, the 8 mg of UCNPs was transferred 
to the Eppendorf tube, then after the centrifugation (30 min, 16900 g), the 500 µl of 
hexane  was  added.  The  mixture  was  sonicated  as  long  as  the  pellet  has  been 
suspended.  After  that,  the  400 µl  of  acetonitrile  and  100 µl  of  0.16 M  NOBF   in 
4
acetonitrile were added to the tube, and the solution was mixed until the particles have 
transferred from the upper hexane layer to the lower acetonitrile layer. In the next step, 
the hexane layer has been removed carefully with a pipette. Finally, the particles were 
precipitated by adding the 500 µl of toluene, vortexed, centrifuged (30 min, 16900 g), 
and after removal of the supernatant, re-dispersed in 100 µl of dry DMF. 
Characterization of synthesized nanoparticles  
Powder diffraction data (Figure S2) of the synthesized UCNPs were collected on an 
X’Pert PRO X-ray diffractometer with a PIXcel ultrafast line detector, a focusing mirror, 
and  Soller  slits  for  Cu  Kα  radiation.  The  measurements  were  done  in  a  Bragg–
Brentano geometry in the 10–120 2Θ range. The XRD patterns were assigned using 
the Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS) database.  
Morphology  and  microstructure  were  investigated  with  TEM-EDX  (double  CS-
corrected  Titan3  G2  60-300  transmission  electron  microscope  by  FEI  Company). 
Severe NP degradation of the NPs occurred under fast under the electron beam. TEM 
studies  of  core  and  core-shell  UCNPs  show  the  nanoparticle  size  (diameter) 
distribution.

Rose Bengal dye titration 
Both the D and A have to be conjugated to other molecules (e.g. antibodies, DNA 
fragments,  etc.)  to  enable  modulation  of  their  distance  by  biospecific  reaction 
molecules  and  use  in  biosensing  applications.  However,  performing  experiments 
involving complexes formed by biospecific binding reactions such as DNP-Ab: Ag-A, 
where  DNP-Ab  means  donor  NP  conjugated  antibody  (Ab)  and  Ag-A  acceptor 
molecule (A) conjugated antigen (Ag), is complex, tedious, and expensive, and also 
prone to experimental variation. Thus a simplified DNP: A sensing approach based on 
anchoring acceptor directly on donor nanoparticle was selected. By coordinating the 
dye directly to the surface, we are able to minimize the D – A distances and see the 
maximal response available upon LRET using the two structurally and compositionally 
different  UCNPs  as  donors.  It  is  true,  that  in  the  practical  bioassays,  the  surface 
chemistry and conjugation will inevitably render the distances longer. Still, the study 
based on the direct binding of the dye on the surface, however, minimizes all the 
uncertainly  related  to  conjugation  chemistry  and  biological  interactions  resulting  in 
variation in the distances and binding efficiencies. 
Due to the fact that LRET and reabsorption of donor emission both give  a similar 
spectral response, distinguishing between LRET and the reabsorption process is not 
a  trivial  task.  In  both  cases,  the  sensitized  emission  of  the  acceptor  dye  will  be 
observed upon excitation of the donor. In the proposed surface blocking experiment 
(Figure S3), we examine the distance dependency of LRET. The idea of it was to 
measure the intensity of the sensitized acceptor emission in two different cases: (1) the 
acceptor was attached directly to the surface, i.e. the distance between D and A is 
minimized, resulting in the occurrence of non-radiative, resonance energy transfer from 
the donor to acceptor; (2) the UCNP surface was blocked by using phosphate buffer. 
Thus, two dye titration series were performed for each particle batch: one with and the 
other without phosphate buffer. First, 0.4 mg of UCNP’s was added to each of the 
samples to the Eppendorf tubes of dry DMF. Then aqueous phosphate buffer was 
added in 1 µl to the one series of the samples. After 15 minutes of incubation, the RB 
acceptor dye was added and dissolved in dry DMF in six concentrations (0, 2.9, 9.8, 
29.5, 98.3, and 294.8 µM).  
The phosphates from the buffer  in the second step bind to the surface, promoting 
negative charge and repulsion towards the acceptor dye, and leaving no space for 
attachment of the dye. In this case, the acceptor dye is only in the surrounding solution 
and not immediately on the surface of the UCNPs. In solution, the dye provides the 
conditions  for  reabsorption of  the  donor  emission,  but  since  the distance  between 
donor and acceptor is on average much beyond the Förster distance, the possibility of 
LRET  is  minimized.  The  results  of  our  experiments  indicated  that  the  sensitized 
acceptor emission is observed only when the acceptor dye is attached directly to the 
surface. When the surface is blocked with phosphate, the emission of the acceptor dye 
is not observed at all with experimental conditions used (i.e. acquisition time) used. 
Our results allow to conclude that the observed sensitized emission of the acceptor is 
excited non-radiatively, i.e. through LRET from the Er3+ ions to the RB molecules.

IV.  Spectroscopic Measurements 
Typically, to get bright up-conversion emission, continuous wave (CW) laser diode 
excitation is used to pump the sensitizer ions, which then continuously up-convert their 
energy to the higher levels of the activator ions. After that, the excited activator ions, 
which act concurrently as donor ions to the acceptor, deliver the excited state energy 
via LRET to the acceptor molecules. In pulsed mode, activator emission is typically 
achieved with powerful pulsed lasers (e.g., OPO, Ti: sapphire, dye lasers, etc.) or with 
a TTL modulated continuous wave laser diodes (LD), which are in the medium-low CW 
power  range.  While  the  pulsed  laser  sources  are  straightforward  and  a  natural 
approach  for  luminescence  lifetime  measurements  (and  RET  quantification),  such 
costly and large footprint lasers are not well suited for RET based assays aimed for 
field use or point-of-care applications. Therefore, we decided to additionally study and 
compare the performance of our UC-LRET assay under such TTL modulated CW laser 
diode.  LDs  are  more  compact  and  robust  light  sources,  with  an  accessible  power 
supply  and  control,  and  thus  is  a  more  cost-effective  solution  for  point-of-care 
miniaturized reading devices. However, due to the complex nature of the sensitized 
energy up-conversion processes, relatively long pulses obtained by TTL modulated 
low/medium  power  CW  laser  diodes  may  not  be  suitable  for  LRET  studies  in 
luminescence kinetic mode. 
 
Luminescence  decay  lifetimes  were  measured  with  three  different  kinds  of  pulse 
excitation: short pulse excitation was performed by tunable laser OPOLLETE 355 LD 
Optical Parametric Oscillator (OPO)  for 980 nm excitation wavelength  with median

pulse  energy  0.093 mJ  (OPO980),  and  for  520 nm  with  measured  median  pulse 
energy 0.107 mJ (OPO520), and long 10 ms pulse excitation was performed by TTL 
controlled infrared CW diode laser MDL-F-980-10 W with a median value of pulse 
energy  0.145 mJ  (TTL980)  (Table  S.  1).  Measurements  of  pulse  energies  were 
performed  with  ES120C  Pyroelectric  Energy  Sensor  (Thorlabs).  Laser  pulses  for 
TTL980 photoexcitation mode were the longest, and had the highest energy value, 
while the photoexcitation with OPO980 and OPO520 had 100 times shorter pulse and 
around 35 and 50 % lower average energy, but much larger momentary pulse intensity 
than in TTL980 (Table S1).

Donor and acceptor wavelength specific luminescence kinetics was recorded using 
a photomultiplier  tube  module  (bandwidth  80  MHz,  averaging  of  1000  pulses)  and 
optical filters characterized in Figure S5. Emission spectra intensity measurements 
were carried out  with CW laser diode (980 nm, ~5 W) excitation and  OceanOptics 
HR4000CG spectrometer (5 s of integration time) readout. 
All the luminescence measurements were carried out for colloidal samples in cuvettes 
in  a homebuilt  setup  (Figure  S4),  in  homemade  quartz  cuvettes  (3 mm  internal 
diameter, 1.5 mm light path from the center) with a 90o light collection configuration. 
Following equation 𝑇 [%] = 100 ∙ 10−𝜀𝑙𝑐, and assuming 90.400 (cm-1 M-1]) at 560 nm, 
0.15 cm optical length (from the center of quartz cuvette to the edge where the readout 
is made), as well as assuming the 10-fold diluted sample were used in the experiments, 
we obtain with the highest RB concentration a theoretical value of transmission equal 
40 %,  which  in  consequence  may  modify  the  shape  of  emission  spectrum  that 
originates from within the center of the cuvette. Indeed, a slight, apparent spectral shift 
of  the  RB  emission  observed  by  us  for  the  rising  concentration  of  RB  should  be 
rationalized by the spectral overlap between RB emission and its absorption 8. The 
molar absorption coefficient of RB also drops at wavelengths below 550 nm and thus 
the  effect  of  RB  absorption  to  donor  emission  is  less  than  the  theoretical  value 
estimated. Additionally, as shown in RB emission is composed of two emission bands. 
In the absorption spectra, there are also bands at 570 nm and 620 nm, which likely 
originate from monomer (longer wavelength) and dimer (shorter wavelength) forms of 
the RB dye, respectively 9. Monomeric and dimeric fractions do not influence quantum 
yields for RB, and RET transmission is influenced by monomers. 10

(b)  time  measurements.  Characterization  of  laser  pulse  used  to  compare 
photoexcitation scheme is presented in Table S1. Spectral properties of optical filters 
used in the experimental setup are given in Figure S5.  
 
Both the 2H  and 4S  energy levels are suitable for RET to RB. The 2H  stays in 
11/2 3/2 11/2
thermal equilibrium with the  4S  level governed by Boltzmann law. Moreover, the 
3/2
2H  level is rapidly and non-radiatively populating the 4S  level. Therefore, the green 
11/2 3/2
Er3+ emission is often described as the 2H  + 4S . It is simple to extract the emission 
11/2 3/2
bands  of  2H   and  4S   from  UC  spectra  (Fig.2),  but  to  measure  luminescence 
11/2 3/2
lifetimes,  we  simplified  the  setup  and  measured  only  4S   (green)  and  4F   (red) 
3/2 9/2
emissions (Figure S4). To measure the luminescence emission lifetimes of the 4S  
3/2
and 4F ,we used two different bandpass filters placed in front of a PMT detector. The 
9/2
FF01-660/30 band-pass filter (transmission between 637 – 681 nm) was used for Er3+ 
ions 4F  level and FB543.5-10 band-pass filter (transmission between 532 – 557 nm) 
9/2
was  used  for  Er3+  ions  for  4S   level.  The  transmission  curves  of  both  filters  are 
3/2
presented in Figure S5a. In addition, FF01-790/SP short-pass filter (790 nm cut-off 
wavelength)  was  used  to  exclude  the  laser  pulse  line  at  980 nm.  A  FELH0550 
(Thorlabs) filter was used to cut-off the 520 nm laser excitation in OPO520 experiments. 
These two filters were used in combination with either 980 nm (matching 2F  → 2F  
7/2 5/2
of Yb3+, indirect Er3+ excitation through ETU) or 520 nm (matching 4I  → 2J , direct 
9/2 11/2
Er3+ ions excitation) excitation lasers. The signal from the PMT photodetector was 
averaged (1000 pulses) using a digital oscilloscope synchronized to the falling (for 
OPO520 and OPO 980) or rising (TTL980) edge of the laser pulse.

V.  The procedure of fitting the luminescence lifetimes 
Depending  on  the  photoexcitation  scheme,  we  proposed  and  used  three  different 
methods  to  quantify  the  kinetic  profiles  of  Er3+  emission,  which  are  presented  in 
Table S2. 
As a supplementation of information from the main article (in Figure 3 and Figure 4), 
we presented all (not only the leading and most significant changes) for luminescence 
kinetics and lifetimes for the 4S  and 4F  levels of Er3+ are shown in Figures S6 and 
3/2 9/2
S9, and additionally supplemented it with residual of luminescence lifetime fitting. We 
present  additionally  emission  of  4F   for  three  types  of  photoexcitation,  as 
9/2
supplementary  for  presented  only  in  article  emission  under  short  indirect 
photoexcitation (OPO980), which indicate the most significant changes.

Luminescence lifetime values were presented in Figure S8, S11 and Table S3, S4. 
Based  on  luminescence  decay  lifetime  we  estimated  the  efficiency  of  resonance 
energy transfer (RET) (Figure S7 and S10). These kinetic data indicate that direct 
photoexcitation of Er3+ ions gives very efficient Resonance Energy Transfer, and some 
differences  between  two  types of  architectures  can  be  observed,  which  owe most 
probably to differences in the number of ions. However, a higher absorption cross-
section of Yb3+ gives higher intensity, and needs lower power density to photoexcite 
nanoparticles, enhances energy migration and energy storage cumulation, and may 
repump (“recharge”) Er3+ ions which hinder ultimate RET efficiency. Interestingly the 
highest changes in RET efficiency are visible for photoexcitation with a short pulse with 
980 nm  wavelength  (OPO980).  Long  980 nm  photoexcitation  pulse  (TTL980)  has 
minimal efficiency changes with dye concentration changes, which can be explained 
by recharging of Er3+ ions with energy transfer upconversion from Yb3+ ions due to 
longer laser pulses, cause greater participation of energy migration that can occur 
between Yb3+ ions. Surprisingly the most significant changes are visible for the rise 
time of 4F , which cannot be directly related to the energy transfer from this level to 
9/2
the singlet state of Rose Bengal. 
Similar conclusions about potentially misleading interpretation of rise- decay kinetics 
of UC in response to RET were recently drawn by Alyatkin et al. in Tm3+/ Yb3+ doped 
UC 11.

VI.  Mathematical methods (kinetic modelling) 
The  luminescence  lifetime  model  was  implemented  with  differential  rate  equations 
(DRE) (Table S9) for transitions between energy levels inside Yb3+ and Er3+ ions, and 
Rose Bengal dye, and the results are presented in Figures 5, S14, and S15. Time-
dependent changes of energy transitions between ions are mainly dependent on the 
distance  between  Er3+  ions  and  RB.  However  additional  parameters  such  as 
concentration  of  D  and  A,  photoexcitation  flux,  or  inert  transition  can  provide  a 
significant role for overall RET efficiency value. In model analogically to the provided 
experiments,  we  simulate  three  types  of  photoexcitation  pulse,  with  two  based  on 
indirect photoexcitation through Yb3+ ions with wavelength 980 nm – long (TTL980) or 
short (OPO980), and one based on direct photoexcitation of Er3+ ions with short pulses 
with wavelength 520 nm (OPO520).  
Model of DRE proposed by Anderson et. al 12 new model with corrected parameters 
energy transfer values is well fitted to pulse laser measurements. The standard model 
corresponds better to long pulse measurement. That can be explained with improved 
measurements setup for lanthanide ions, and nowadays possibility of using the shorter 
photoexcitation pulses for lifetime curve analysis. Probably with very short pulses with 
higher energy, there are activated different processes that are more visible on the 
experimental and theoretical values. That leads to the conclusion that both models 
work very well with different energy regimes and time of pulse, but this leads us to 
check  additional  possibilities  of  energy  scheme  that  corresponds  to  all  tested 
photoexcitation models (experimentally and theoretically). 
With an increasing concentration of RB acceptor dye, we can see faster rise and decay 
luminescence lifetimes for D energy level (4S , Er3+), quenching of this level by LRET 
3/2
mechanism to RB attached, and should not be explained with blocking quenching to 
environment such as water (see material paragraph about Rose Bengal dye titration). 
Here we can also observe enhanced of red emission changes (4F ), which is not 
9/2
directly responsible for RET mechanism (due to energy overlap between from 4S  
3/2
energy level of Er3+ and RB acceptor dye). That could be explained by processes such 
as  nonradiative  emission  from  4S   to  4F ,  energy  migration,  photoexcitation 
3/2 9/2
pathways, or Er3+, which influence the fulfillment of the energy level that is responsible 
for the LRET mechanism. For three different types of photoexcitation schemes, the 
preferable one with the highest efficiencies is for short and indirect photoexcitation 
pulses.  Additionally,  the  concentration  of  ions  or  organic  dyes  involved  in  energy 
transfer  processes  and  the  value  of  W   have  a  high  impact  on  the  explored 
ETU
processes, especially on the LRET changes visible in the rise and decay times of 
luminescence. 
Comparing results from the model and trends from the experimental data, we assume 
that there is a very thin border between various types of excitation schemes. The first 
standard photoexcitation with 980 nm laser of Yb3+ ions, causes transition between 
following energy levels 2F  → 2F , afterward energy transfer up-conversion to Er3+ 
7/2 5/2
ions occurs. However, energy transfer up-conversion, energy migration, and double 
(to 4I  energy level) or triple photoexcitation pathway (to 4G  energy level) could 
11/2 11/2
have  a  significant  role,  which  we  observe  in  differential  rate  equations  model  and 
experiments (applying short and long time of photoexcitation laser). The second less 
- 23 - 
 

typical proposed photoexcitation pathway is direct of Er3+ ions (between 4I  → 4F  
11/2 7/2
energy levels, then we can observe nonradiative emission to the most interesting in a 
few of RET energy levels - 4S  and 2H ), which is schematically shown in Figure 1 
3/2 11/2
and Figure S12.  
 
VI.A.  Equations and parameters for kinetics modeling 
Implementation and solving differential rate equations for energy transitions levels of 
Yb and Er system (rate equation presented in Table S9 and values of parameters 
presented in Table S10) are based on results of Bergstrand et al 13 and Anderson et 
al 12. The results are shown in Figure 5. Implementation of the differential equation 
were  written  in  Matlab  software,  for  solving  differential  equations,  we  used  ode45 
(based on the Runge-Kutta formula). The simplified energy level for an implemented 
model scheme of Yb3+ and Er3+ is presented in Figures 1 and S12.

Astonishingly, the same rates were however, unsuitable for fitting the luminescence 
kinetics profiles for longer (4 ms) and low peak energy laser pulses from TTL controlled 
CW laser diode. In the latter case, the other set of energy transfer up-conversion rates 
gave  better  agreement.  Actually,  we  found  it  striking  that  also  previous  literature 
reports on this Yb-Er system propose various DRE rate constants depending on the 
photoexcitation scheme. According to Berry et al., despite the Yb-Er system being the 
- 24 - 
 

most well known and most versatilely studied up-conversion system so far, there is still 
a need to revisit these parameters 12. Unfortunately, it seems impossible to obtain a 
general and exact set of DRE rate parameters, describing photoexcitation schemes 
well different. In particular, the same set of rate constant does not, currently allow to 
consider the (a) photoexcitation pulse length or photon flux (e.g. to compare short pulse 
(around 10 ns) to longer pulses (about a few milliseconds) excitations with high or low 
pulse  energy).  Moreover,  this  DRE  model  dismisses  energy  migration  with  Yb3+ 
sensitizer  14  or  Er3+  ions  15  network  between  pairs  of  ions  such  as  Yb – Er14,16  or 
Er – Tm 17 which have significant contribution quantified with simulations 15,16,18 in the 
donor luminescence and kinetics of the UC-LRET system. This means, that despite 
being relatively detailed, the existing Yb-Er DRE models are still incomplete.  
Because the Yb3+ – Er3+ up-converting system is quite complex in terms of a number 
of interdependent processes, we have tried to adopt reasonable simplifications. First 
of all, we have considered the processes occurring only between energy levels below 
4F  level (with energy < 25000 cm-1) which anyway enables to comprehend the role 
7/2
of different modes of the photoexcitation on the up-conversion emission. Secondly, this 
model was further expanded with a singlet-singlet transition of the energy acceptor, 
whose  excitation  band  spectrally  overlaps  with  4S  + 2H   energy  levels  of  Er3+ 
3/2 11/2
donors. To do so, we have combined the above-mentioned DRE model with the D-A 
interaction term (explained in SI section VI Mathematical methods), which described 
how the acceptor modifies the kinetic behavior of major Er3+ energy levels (4S  and 
3/2
4F ). We could, therefore numerically solve these DRE to theoretically predict and 
9/2
gain  some  basic  understanding  on  the  way  the  RET  phenomenon  changes  the 
temporal  behavior  of  the  Yb3+ - Er3+  up-converting  system  under  different 
photoexcitation schemes. We performed our calculations for fixed parameters of pump 
power, energy transfer rates (tabulated in Table S8), and concentration of lanthanide 
ion dopants while testing the outcome of DRE modelling with just a few concentrations 
of Rose Bengal acceptor.

Most of the data due to the same physical constant are easily comparable between 
experiment and theoretical model (such as photoexcitation wavelength, time, or energy 
of pulse). Because of the unification of physical constants between multiplied values, 
the concentration of dopant ion in the given volume in theoretical calculations are given 
in cm-3 (in which is also given energy levels of Ln3+ values and values of transition 
probabilities  rates),  while  in  experiment  concentration are given in  µM  (due  to  the 
calculations of volume and mass of used constants). 
Power density, energy and flux of energy used in model for photoexcitation wavelength 
from laser is presented in equation below 19

The  acceptor  (RB)  concentration  were  provided  for  calculations  as  RB  molecules 
averaged over ions per cm-3, taking into account normalized k  between D-A pair 
LRET
and assuming a number of RB in the following numbers: 0, 1019, 1020, 1021, 1022, 1023, 
1024.  Assuming  that  W   includes  a  number  of  acceptors  (NA)  and  critical 
RET
concentration, which is dependent on D – A distance, this parameter can be described 
as a micro parameter, and averaged for whole NPs for inside and outside Ln3+ ion

VI.B.  Influence of power and concentration on donor luminescence lifetimes  
Energy transfer energy value can influence the luminescence curves of Er3+ ions. The 
tendency of luminescence decay curves changes of Er3+ ions as acceptor influence 
behavior and analysis of Resonance Energy Transfer between Er3+ and RB (figure 
S13). Power changes in theoretical measurements, show that maximal implemented 
power gives luminescence decay lifetimes without rise times, probably due to high 
pump  power  (figure  S14).  Starting  parameters  were  analogical  with  values  to  the 
experiments. Although probably not 100 % pumping power in experiment gives energy 
to Yb3+ ions. This can be caused due to scattering of energy by cuvette or solution in 
which nanocrystals with dyes are dissolved. According to Figures S13 and S14 we 
can assume that a faster energy transfer rate (k ) between Yb3+ and Er3+ ions and 
ET
smaller than maximal refill of energy levels under photoexcitation power can cause 
donor luminescence lifetime curve to be more susceptible to changes under acceptor 
presence.

In  the  simulation  (differential  rate  equations),  we  implemented  three  types  of 
photoexcitation pulse, including proper length of pulse and value of energy analogical 
used in the experiment. In rate equations, we define concentrations and a fraction of 
ions involved in Energy Transfer Upconversion (ETU) between Yb3+ and Er3+ ions. As 
a proposal based on our experimental and theoretical data, there is observed that 
photoexcitation can emphasize different transitions between different energy levels. 
Luminescence lifetime properties can be influenced by photoexcitation pulse time and 
energy.  These  types  of  input  changes  can  expose  more  energy  transfer  between 
sensitizer (Yb3+) and activator (Er3+).  
Based on the model luminescence lifetime curve for the donor, we can calculate the 
efficiency of RET, which indicate further changes. We indicated processes such as 
how fast energy is transferred between lanthanides ions (Figure S13) and how many 
donor ions (Er3+) we photoexcite with laser (Figure S14).
