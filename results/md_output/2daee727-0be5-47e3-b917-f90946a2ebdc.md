Methods 
Distribution of the primary outcome 
The primary outcome (number of ICD-10 codes for back pain) has a highly skewed distribution 
with a considerable quantity of zero’s (Figure S1 below).

Candidate variables 
We selected a broad sequence of variables from both data sources, which were presumably 
related to the frequency of low back pain episodes as indicated by ICD-10 codes. Table S4 in 
Exploratory variable selection shows the selected candidate variables after revision of univariate 
associations  and  interaction  terms.  In  addition  to  these  variables,  we  examined  univariate 
associations of the following variables with the outcome: 
•  job type (e.g. farmer, freelancer) 
•  average von Korff back pain severity 
•  comorbidities: diabetes (yes vs. no), diabetes with complications (no vs. diabetes without 
complications vs. diabetes with complications), heart failure, atrial fibrillation, myocardial 
infarction, stroke, cancer 
•  interaction terms: PHQ-9 strata: sex. 
Compared to the employment/workability status (Table S4), the job type was hardly associated 
with the outcome. Instead of the average of two von Korff items (back pain severity, impairment 
due to back pain), we used the original items in the modelling process. The above mentioned 
comorbidities (diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer) origin from interviews of the SHIP 
participants and represent self-reported diseases. We summarized them into a single variable 
named competing diseases (none, one, >one of: diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer) as 
all univariate coefficients indicated a negative association with the number of ICD-10 codes. Using 
claims data, we were able to compute the Charlson comorbidity index based on the approach 
from [1].  
Non-linear associations 
The presence of non-linear associations was examined using a generalized additive model [2] 
provided by the R package mgcv. To discriminate nonlinear effects in the zero-part from those in 
the count-part we applied two types of models: (a) a binomial distribution for the zero-part and 
(b) negative binomial for the count-part.

Figure S2: Nonlinear associations of covariates with the presence of ICD-10 codes for back pain 
(yes/no). 
 
The results from this model suggest non-linear associations in the zero-part of the model for age, 
SF12 PCS, PHQ-9 sum score, and house income. Regarding the count-part none of the candidate 
variables appears to have non-linear associations, as effective degrees of freedom are all close to 
1. 
There are some caveats: the household income in the SHIP data represents a transformed variable. 
Participants of the SHIP study were asked about their income in non-equidistant categories [([0; 
 
7 
 

500), [500; 900), [900; 1300), [1300; 1800), [1800; 2300), [2300; 2800), [2800; 3300), [3300; 3800), 
3800; Inf)). These categories were then transformed along the interval means and standardized 
according the number of individuals living in the respective household (√# 𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑑𝑢𝑎𝑙𝑠). The 
respective values appear to be continuous, but base in fact on categorical values (please see also 
Figure S3 below). We therefore decided to not model a nonlinear functional form (spline) of this 
variable. 
In summary, based on AIC information criteria, we considered restricted natural splines for age 
(degrees of freedom df=4) and SF12 physical component scale (df=2) as candidate variables.

Exploratory variable selection 
Best subset selection is computationally expensive with 2p-1 possible combinations of covariates. 
To  minimize  computational  time  we  applied  model  based  boosting  (MBB)  to  conduct  an 
explorative variable selection for the SHIP data. MBB is applicable in high-dimensional settings 
(n<<p) and in the presence of multi-collinearity [3]. The latter is of particular interest for our 
approach since we examined some variables in alternative forms, e.g. age (original, discretized, 
smoothed). 
In brief, MBB starts from an intercept model in which each base-learner or candidate variable is 
iteratively evaluated in terms of fitting a loss function (negative log-likelihood) best. In each 
iteration only the best base-learner, with respect to minimizing residual sum of squares, will be 
used to update the model [3]. The R package mboost [4] has been used to build the MBB model 
in 2000 iterations (maximum mstop). Usually the best model is then identified via resampling. 
However,  we  applied  stability  selection  [5]  after  model  building  to  select  covariates  being 
predictive  in  20%  of  the  resampled  data,  i.e. contributing  to  the  model  in  at  least  20%  of 
resampled data. This setting is less restrictive, i.e. more variables are retained, recommendations 
suggest  to  choose  a  threshold  of  50%  or  higher  [5].  However,  we  pursued  an  initial  set  of 
promising  candidate  variables  and  to  remove  competing  effect  definitions,  we  omitted  the 
evaluation of the optimal MBB model. All predictors as specified in Table S4 were examined as 
candidate learners. 
In  case  of  alternative  effect  definition,  e.g.  regarding  age,  we  chose  the  effect  with  highest 
selection frequency in MBB.

Best subset 
From a vector of candidate variables (in the following example A, B, C) we specified a matrix of all 
their possible combinations in the following manner: 
# Variables: A, B, and C
 
covars <- c("A", "B", "C") 
# each of these variables can be selected (1) or not (0)
 
ps <- rep(list(0:1), length(covars)) 
# create all possible combinations
 
ps_claims <- expand.grid(ps) 
# remove row in which all variables are "Null"
 
ps_claims <- ps_claims[-1, ]
 
names(ps_claims) <- covars

Model training algorithm 
Model training and evaluation should be conducted in separate data to avoid overfitting [6]. In 
absence of external (independent) validation data, so-called internal validation of a model should 
be applied, i.e. using a subsample of the same data source which is not involved in model training. 
This approach is inferior to an external validation [7] but the crucial model evaluation step to build 
predictive models. 
We  adapted  a  common  approach  of  model  validation  as  described  by  Filzmoser  et.  al  [8]. 
Therefore, the SHIP-TREND-0 data were randomly splitted into training-data and validation-data 
in a ratio of 3:1 (n=2869:968). Figure S4 shows the scheme of this approach: 
 
Figure S4: Scheme of the Validation algorithm to assess model prediction accuracy. 
 
In each step of the nested model training we iterated over a matrix of predictors (please see Best 
subset for explanation) and conducted zero-inflated Poisson and negative-binomial count data 
models for all possible combinations of covariates. Respective information criteria (AIC) have 
been saved in each iteration to choose the most appropriate distribution type after completion 
of the nested model training. Each model result was used to predict the outcome of interest in 
the nested validation data. 
 
12 
 

The accuracy of the nested prediction performance has been evaluated using the strictly proper 
scoring rules of Brierscore and the Dawid-Sebastiani-Score [9–11]. The calculation and notation 
of these scores is mentioned under Scores for model calibration and has been applied using the 
R package surveillance [12]. 
Overall, this scheme was applied three times: 
▪  1st for the claims data 
▪  2nd for the SHIP data 
▪  3rd for the joined data using only the best subset from either claims and SHIP. 
Due to the computational complexity, e.g. 8.191.000 models (213- 1 subsets * 500 samples * 2 
distributions) were calculated for the claims data alone, we used the R package doParallel [13] to 
apply parallel  computations.  Further,  we used  the high-performance-cluster provided  by  the 
computation center of the University of Greifswald [14].  
Scores for model calibration 
We used two strictly proper scoring rules to evaluate a model’s prediction accuracy. For the zero-
part of the zero-inflated count data regression we used the Brier score [15] and for the count-part 
the Dawid-Sebastiani score [9, 10]. The Brierscore has the following notation: 
1
𝐵𝑆 = ∑𝑁 (𝑝 − 𝑜 )2 . 
𝑖=1 𝑖 𝑖
𝑁
where 𝑝  is the predicted probability for individual 𝑖 and 𝑜  the observed event of individual 𝑖. 
𝑖 𝑖
The Dawid-Sebastiani score has the following notation for a negative-binomial [11] count data 
regression: 
1 (𝑦 −𝜇 )2 𝜇
𝐷𝑆𝑆 = ∑𝑁 ( 𝑖 𝑖 + 𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝜇 (1 + 𝑖))). 
(𝑁𝐵𝐵) 𝑁 𝑖=1 𝜇 (1+𝜇 𝑖 ) 𝑖 𝜃
𝑖
𝜃
and in terms of a Poisson distribution with 𝜇 = 𝜎2 = 𝜆: 
1 (𝑦 −𝜆 )2
𝐷𝑆𝑆 = ∑𝑁 ( 𝑖 𝑖 + 𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝜆 )). 
(𝑃𝑜𝑖) 𝑖=1 𝑖
𝑁 𝜆
𝑖
The calculation of these scores is implemented in the R package surveillance [12].

Missing data 
Imputation setting 
The overall frequency of missing values was low (<5%). Nevertheless, we first applied multiple 
imputations using chained equations provided by the R package mice ([16]). The imputation was 
conducted independently for training data and validation data. 
Transformed variables, such as body mass index and strata of the PHQ score, were not imputed; 
instead passive imputation has been used, which was defined as: 
# mice::methods for imputation
 
meths["bmi"] <- "~I(weight/((height/100)^2))"
 
 
# a customized function to categorize phq score into strata
 
mycutfun <- function(x) {
 
 x <- cut(x, 
 
          right = FALSE,
 
          breaks = c(0, 1, 5, 10, 15, Inf),
 
          labels = c("no signs", "minimal", "mild", "moderate", "severe"))
 
 
 
}
 
 
# mice::methods for imputation
 
meths["phq_strata"] <- "~I(mycutfun(phq_sum_score))"

Imputation diagnostics 
We used inbuilt functions of the R package mice for imputation diagnostics. Further, variance 
increase (%) by using Rubins’ rule [17] for calculating the pooled variance from  the variance 
between and within the imputed data sets. 
Overall, the increase in variance was very low, for most covariates <1%. Due the small increase in 
variance and in line with recommendations for the application of multiple imputations in case of 
missingness < 5% [18] we restricted the imputations to 𝑚 = 1 in the training data.  
However, the validation data contained m=20 imputations.

Comparative analyses 
For comparative analysis and benchmarking of the best subset approach we applied randomforest 
(RF) and support vector machines (SVM) in this study. Both machine learning approaches have 
been shown to provide excellent prediction accuracy [19–21]. 
In RF, bootstraps of original data, i.e. random samples of the data with replacement, are used to 
built ensembles of uncorrelated decision trees on so-called in-bag observations. It is advised to 
built a high number of trees (ntree) in RF but the number of trees is not considered a tuning 
parameter [22]. More important impact on prediction accuracy have: 
•  the number of variables (mtry) considered for splitting the trees 
•  the minimum terminal node size (nodesize), and 
•  the sample size of inner bootstraps (sampsize). 
We have used the R package tuneRanger to conduct this tuning.

resulting  from  a  tuned  random  forest  approach  (mtry=9,  nodesize=60,  sampsize  =  1674, 
ntree=10000). 
 
For parameter tuning of SVM we applied the R package e1071 [23] using a radial basis function 
kernel for non-linear associations. This kernel requires tuning of two parameters only: a constant 
of costs C which controls model complexity, and the parameter 𝛾 which determines the radius or 
the area of influence of observations on support vectors. 
We applied a two-step grid search [24] to obtain an optimal parameter setting. First, coarsened 
over 𝐶 ∈ 2−2:2  and 𝛾 ∈ 2−5:1  which resulted in optimal 𝐶 = 1 and 𝛾 = 0.03125. Second, over a 
fine grid of 𝐶 ∈ [0.6;1.9] with increments of 0.1, and 𝛾 ∈ [0.1;0.5] with increments of 0.1. The 
best parameter was found to be 𝐶 = 1.3 and 𝛾 = 0.02.

Results 
Association of covariates 
For most continuous or count variables we found low to moderate associations. Particularly the 
association of self-reported back pain (SHIP-data) with the frequency of ICD-10 codes for back 
pain (claims data) was low.

Best subset selection 
In this section, the distribution of mean scores across all 500 bootstrap samples is shown for the 
individual candidate variable, the full set and the best subset of all candidate variables. The scores 
obtained for the models in the claims data are much lower on average, i.e. the predictive value 
of these variables is higher than those for the SHIP data. 
Computational times for best subset were 28h for claims and SHIP data on two nodes à 16 cores, 
and 21h for joined best subsets on one node à 16 cores.

Goodness of fit 
To visualize the fit of the optimal model obtained from the joined data we used rootograms [25]. 
The bars in Figure S13 correspond to the observed counts of ICD-10 codes. The red line indicates 
the fitted response of the hurdle model from a Poisson distribution. 
 
Figure S13: Rootograms of the optimal model from the joined data evaluated in training data and 
the validation data. 
 
By  design,  the  counts  of  the  zero-part  are  perfectly  fitted  in  the  training  data  and  slightly 
overestimated in the validation data, i.e. in the validation data the actual counts are slightly lower 
than what has been estimated by the model. The model fit is very reasonable.

Prediction accuracy and missing data 
In Figure S14 we have depicted the ROC curves of predictions in the validation data for each 
imputed data set (m=20). 
 
Figure  S14:  ROC  curves  for  the  best  subset  model  applied  on  validation  data  with  multiple 
imputations. 
  
There  is  almost  no  difference  between  the  different  data  sets  which  relates  (a)  to  the  low 
magnitude of missing data in most covariates and (b) that particularly in those variables selected 
as the best subset missingness was <1%.
