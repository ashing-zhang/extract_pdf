Abstract 
The utilization of accolade awards to incentivize reviewers is highly common, but its 
effectiveness  remains  uncertain.  This  study  seeks  to  investigate  how  receiving  an 
accolade award affects reviewers’ subsequent motivation. We perform a large-scale, 
global, and all-disciplinary analysis based on quasi-natural experiments. 6604 awarded 
reviewers  and  179,737  reviewers  are  matched  as  experimental  and  control  groups 
respectively. The difference-in-differences (DID) method is conducted to examine the 
accolade awarding effects. After receiving an accolade award, reviewers, on average, 
reviews about four fewer manuscripts, and this reduction follows a V-shaped pattern. 
Additional  analyses  are  conducted  to  examine  how  individual  differences  and 
economic-cultural factors influence the accolade awarding effects. The sharp decrease 
in marginal utility of accolades, the ethical nature of peer review, and the unexpected 
properties of accolade awards are the mechanisms that generate the negative effect. The 
academic community should reassess the existing incentive strategies on reviewers.

1. Introduction 
In 2018, a survey in Nature News (Vesper, 2018) reports that journal editors consider 
identifying suitable reviewers as the most challenging task. The term “peer-review 
crisis” is coined to characterize the scarcity of reviewers and their lack of motivation 
(Petrescu  &  Krishen,  2022).  This  issue  has  persisted  for  an  extended  period  and 
continues to be an ongoing challenge (Bianchi & Squazzoni, 2015; DeLisi, 2022). 
 
Nowadays, the primary approach to incentivize reviewers is by establishing accolade 
awards (Zaharie & Seeber, 2018), like “2022 Outstanding Reviewer”. However, limited 
empirical  research  has  been  conducted  to  thoroughly  examine  how  peer  review 

accolade  awards  influence  the  subsequent  motivation  of  reviewers.  The  issue  of 
motivating  peer reviewers  is  of complexity. Various  studies  based  on  artificial  and 
small-scale experiments reached conflicting conclusions (Robinson et al., 2021) under 
varying context. While individual differences and the economic-cultural environment 
are two significant influencing factors (Gagné & Deci, 2005; Ryan & Deci, 2020). 
Therefore, it is highly necessary to have a large and representative sample, and consider 
the influence of individual and economic-cultural factors simultaneously. 
 
When theorizing the peer review incentives, there are certain points to note. According 
to the peer review motivation frameworks (Zaharie & Osoian, 2016), when analyzing 
incentive mechanisms of peer review accolades, taking account its impact on reviewers’ 
self-achievement  and  prosocial  motivation  is  necessary.  For  self-achievement 
motivation, the diminishing marginal utility of academic influence from peer review 
accolades is particularly pronounced. For the prosocial motivation, review activities are 
ethical in nature and are often seen as an academic responsibility. And it is important to 
emphasize  the  unexpected  nature  of  accolade  awards,  as  expected  and  unexpected 
awards have different effects (Neckermann & Yang, 2017).   
 
Publons, a global peer review platform, grants the annual “Global Peer Review Award” 
to outstanding reviewers from 2017 to 2019. This presents an opportunity to examine 
the  influence  of  the  peer  review  accolade  awards  on  reviewers’  motivation  in  a 
representative way. 
 
This study aims to address the following purposes. (1). Investigate the impact of peer 
review accolade awards on the subsequent motivation of reviewers, using a highly 
representative  sample  and  quasi-natural  experiment  method.  (2).  Explore  how 
individual differences and economic-cultural factors influence the accolade awarding 
effect. (3). Based on the empirical results, this study will try to provide a thorough 
explanation  of  the  mechanisms  behind  the  accolade  awarding  effect,  and  propose 
strategies for motivating reviewers. 
 
2. Data and Methodology 
Unlike artificial experiments, quasi-experiments allow for large-scale inferences and 
occur naturally, resembling real-life scenarios. The peer review activities are easily 
influenced  by  various  factors,  like  economic-cultural  backgrounds  and  individual 
differences. To achieve highly representative causal inferences, we aim to utilize quasi-
experimental methods based on a large and representative sample. 
 
2.1 Data 
The data in this study is acquired by integrating the Publons, ORCID, and OpenAlex 
database.   
 
Publons (https://publons.com) is recognized as one of the largest global peer review 
platforms. Nature has also acknowledged and reported on Publons (Van Noorden, 2014). 

This study aims to conduct  empirical research based on the Publons data. Publons 
implements annually a selection process to identify the top 1% of reviewers in their 
respective fields from 2017 to 2019, and awards these individuals with the “Publons 
Global Peer Review Award”. Due to various reasons, the award has ceased since 2019. 
To prevent biases in heterogeneous multi-period DID analysis (De Chaisemartin & 
d’Haultfoeuille, 2020), we focused on 6604 peer review winners in 2018, and make 
sure that the control group excludes winners in 2017 and 2019. Therefore, the pre-
treatment duration of the experimental group extends from 2012 to 2017 (a total of six 
years), and the period of after-treatment spans from 2019 to 2023 (a total of five years). 
 
We initially select the authors with more than 10 publications in OpenAlex database, a 
total of 2,678,929 authors. In ORCID database, 357,948 authors have established the 
link between ORCID and ResearcherID. The review data of scholars is acquired via 
ResearcherID.   
 
Name disambiguation is also performed using three golden author databases, namely 
OpenAIRE (Manghi et al., 2019), EMAKG (Pollacci, 2022), and LAGOS‐AND (Zhang 
et al., 2023).   
 
In summary, a panel data of reviewers spanning from 2012 to 2023 is established, totally 
179,737 reviewers. Data collection is conducted from August 10 to August 27, 2023.   
 
2.2 Inferring method 
The  validity  of  the  two-way  fixed  effects  model  (TWFE)  commonly  used  in  DID 
analysis,  but  has  been  questioned  in  recent  years  (Callaway  &  Sant’Anna,  2021; 
Goodman-Bacon,  2021).  Liu  et  al.  (Liu  et  al.,  2022)  introduced  a  framework  for 
counterfactual estimation, named as “ifect estimation”, which has been proved to be 
effective at relaxing the assumptions of TWFE model. Hence, we adopt this method for 
DID, using the fect package in R language developed by Liu et al. 
 
The assumption of parallel trends presents a main challenge for the DID method. To 
meet this assumption, propensity score matching (PSM) is used to create a control 
group closely resembling the experimental group with a similar pre-treatment change 
pattern.  In  panel  data  matching,  two  commonly  used  methods  are  single-period 
matching and period-by-period matching. Multiple studies have highlighted concerns 
about the irrationality of period-by-period matching (Stuart, 2010). In this study, the 
former method is adopted, which typically focuses on the first period (2012) as the 
matching period. Hence, reviewers with one or more reviews are initially extracted 
from  the  dataset,  as  well  as  scholars’  academic  age,  gender,  discipline,  cumulative 
number of publications, and cumulative citations as matched variables. Finally, 762 
reviewers are identified from 179,737 samples as the control group by utilizing the 
MatchIt  (Stuart  et  al.,  2011)  package  in  the  R  language. The  research  specifically 
focusses on the 2018 winners, totaling 6604 samples. We exclude the 2017 and 2019 
winners,  totaling  3251  individuals.  The  chosen  period  for  comparison  was  2012, 

namely the first year. 711 reviewers are identified as the experimental groups. 
 
2.3 Variables 
The dependent variable in our study is the annual number of reviews. The independent 
variable pertains to the DID, whether is an accolade award winner and the year is over 
2018 (after the 2018 Publons Global Peer Review Award). Prior to 2018 (specifically, 
from 2012 to 2017), the winners are considered as before treatment. The accolade award 
winners from 2018 onwards (2018-2023) will be regarded as having been treated. In 
the control group that does not receive the award, the time frame spanning from 2012 
to 2023 are all considered as the untreated period. 
 
It remains necessary to control for as many of these variables as possible to derive more 
precise and reliable conclusions.  Based on prior evidence,  number of publications, 
cumulative number of citations, academic age, number of collaborators, number of 
(second-level) disciplines, the intersection of a scholar’s academic age and cumulative 
citations, as well as the intersection of academic age and number of publications will 
be controlled in this study.

3. Results 
3.1 PSM results 
In this study, the earliest period (2012) is selected for matching. Reviewers’ career age, 
first-level  discipline,  seniority,  gender,  and  bibliometrics  data  in  2012  are  taken  as 
matching variables. MatchIt utilizes logistic regression to estimate the propensity score, 
following the suggestion made by Ho et al. (Ho et al., 2007), and the non-parametric 
nearest distance method is employed in this study. After completing the matching, we 
assess the matching effect by comparing the SMD before and after matching. After 
matching, all SMDs are below 0.1, with only a few variables having SMDs exceeding 
0.05. The matching effect is satisfactory. 
 
3.2 PSM-DID results 
3.2.1 Parameter estimations 
The DID results are presented in Table 2. When including control variables and fixed 
effects, the coefficient for DID is -4.06. This suggests a decline in reviewer enthusiasm 
after receiving the Publons Global Peer Review Award.

Furthermore, we plot the average treatment effects on treated (ATTs), as shown in 
Figure 1. It is evident that the average ATTs is about -4 after treatment, and the trend 
demonstrates a V-shape pattern. After undergoing a consecutive decline for four years, 
this negative trend will slow down to some extent.

3.2.2 Parallel trend tests and placebo tests 
The F test is commonly used for pre-trend testing. A higher p-value from the F-test 
suggests a better fit of the parallel trend. In the fect package, the TOST checks whether 
the 90% confidence intervals for the estimated ATTs in pretreatment periods exceed 
the equivalence range. A smaller p-value for the TOST indicates a better fit to the pre-
trend. In this study, the p-value of F test and TOST are 0.218 and 0 respectively, passing 
both the F test and the TOST test at a significance level of 5% (F>0.05, T<0.05). 
 
The placebo test in this study involves the p-value of the F test and the p-value of TOST. 
The p-value of the F-test in our analysis is 0.518, significantly greater than 0.05, and 
the TOST is 0, passing the placebo test. 
 
3.3 Additional analysis 
3.3.1 Individual differences and awarding effects 
By analysing existing literature on peer review motivation, this study examines six 
variables:  academic  age,  seniority,  funding,  social  capital,  interdisciplinarity,  and 
gender of reviewers, to understand their influence on the awarding effect. Moderating 
effects are mainly employed. For gender effect analysis, subgroup modelling will be 
used. 
 

Table 3 shows that academic age, seniority, social capital, and gender significantly 
influence  the  awarding  effect.  The  remaining  variables,  including  funding  and 
interdisciplinarity, are not statistically significant. For reviewers with higher seniority 
and social capital, winning the accolade awards will make a more significant negative 
impact.  There  is  a  noticeable  decrease  in  motivation  among  male  reviewers  after 
receiving an accolade. For women, this accolade award has no impact. Both male and 
female subgroup models passed the parallel trend test, with p-values being both 0, and 
TOST test values are 0.384, 0.582 respectively. The lack of significance within the 
female group is not attributed to the smaller sample size. When a sample of 131 men is 
randomly selected, the p-value of the DID coefficient obtained is also less than 0.01.

3.3.2 Economic-cultural factors and awarding effects 
This  study  will  use  country-based  group  modeling  to  analyze  how  scholars  from  different 
nations react to the peer review accolade. To maintain the sample size, we increased the number 
of matched control groups and created the control group in a 1:3 ratio. The construction methods’ 
matching also passed the parallel test. Then, countries with sample sizes below 30 are excluded. 
Countries with p-values below 0.2 are retained.   
 
Of  the  28  countries  studied,  relevant  indicators,  such  as  income  level  (IMF  standards), 
Confucian  culture,  official  language  (English  usage),  and  scientific  research  performance 
(national-level citations, number of publications, and H-index) are collected. The variables of 
H-index, number of citations, and number of publications are the average values of countries 
from 2012 to 2023. A regression analysis is conducted to examine the impact of these factors 
on the awarding effects by analyzing the coefficients of the difference-in-differences (DID) 
estimator.   
 
In Table 4, the impact of income level and national scientific research influence (H-index) on 
awarding suggests that high levels of income and advanced scientific research can mitigate the 
negative effects of accolades. All other factors are not significant.

4. Discussions and conclusions 
4.1 Mechanisms of awarding reviewers 
After receiving a peer review accolade award, reviewers’ sequent motivation decreased. This 
seems counterintuitive.   
 
The theoretical framework of peer review motivation emphasizes the academic impact obtained 
from  peer  review  as  a  primary  motivator. As  reiterated  numerous  times,  peer  review  is  a 
voluntary undertaking. For reviewers motivated by self-achievement, peer review awards only 
can primarily offer them academic influence. However, the reduction in the marginal utility of 
academic influence offered by peer review accolade is significant. Thus, reviewers who are 
motivated by self-achievement may experience a natural decline in motivation of reviewing 
after receiving an accolade award. 
 
The ethical nature of peer review contributes to the negative incentive effect. Most reviewers 
are typically scholars. For a scientific system to operate in a sustainable way, it requires enough 
reviewers. Numerous studies emphasize that publishing is a privilege for scholars, while peer

review is seen as an obligation (Nash, 2023). Accolade awards winners may perceive awards 
as a sign that their review performance exceeds the academia’s expectations and obligation 
(Gallus & Frey, 2017), then they may decline number of reviews (Monin & Miller, 2001; 
Mullen & Monin, 2016).   
 
The unexpected nature of peer review accolades will increase this negative impact (Robinson 
et al., 2021). Unexpected accolade awards significantly reinforce the winner’s higher awareness 
of surpassing social norms upon receiving the award. Because the winners are unaware that 
they have surpassed social norms before receiving the award (Neckermann & Yang, 2017). 
 
These mechanisms are supported by various findings outlined in the Additional Analysis section. 
Male reviewers are often seen as more driven by self-achievement motivations, especially in 
terms  of  the  academic  influence  which  benefits  career  advancement  (Meece  et  al.,  2009). 
Reviewers with higher seniority,  higher career years, and more social capital experience a 
significant drop in motivation after receiving peer review accolades. This phenomenon may be 
due to the fact that they have likely already achieved a higher level of academic influence, 
resulting in a more significant diminishing marginal effect. In regions with less developed 
economies and research strength, the negative effects on scholars’ incentives will be more 
significant. This phenomenon can be explained at two different levels. (1) Conducting reviews 
is  more  expensive  in  developing  regions.  In  developing  regions,  scholars  may  face  more 
economic limitations, leading them to prioritize scientific and teaching activities with higher 
economic benefits, thus more potentially neglect the review activities. (2) The accolade award 
in this study is an international honor. In developing regions, the international award may be 
more surprising, making the award more unexpected. Individuals are more likely to perceive 
themselves  as  surpassing  international  standards  after  receiving  accolades,  leading  to  a 
reduction in their motivation. 
 
4.2 Conclusions 
Upon a representative investigation, we first find that the peer review accolade awards will 
reduce the sequent number of reviews. We examine the impact of relevant factors on this 
awarding effect, explain the mechanism of this awarding effect. The research questions outlined 
in Introduction are well addressed. The answers to these questions and main research findings 
can be summarized as follows: 
 
(1) Peer review accolades will create a negative awarding effect. After receiving the Publons 
Global Peer Review Award, there is typically an average reduction of about four reviews. 
 
(2)  The  awarding  effect  is  influenced  by  individual  and  economic-cultural  factors.  Higher 
academic seniority, more social capital, higher academic age, female scholars, scholars from 
lower income level or less advanced scientific research regions are likely to reduce a greater 
number of reviews after receiving the accolade award. 
 
(3)  Certain  mechanisms  are  proposed  to  explain  negative  awarding  effect.  The  negative 
incentive may stem from the diminishing marginal utility nature of academic influence, the 
ethical nature of peer review, and the unexpected properties of accolade awards. According to 
these proposed mechanisms, we put forward potential strategies for advancement.
