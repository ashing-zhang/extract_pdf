Introduction 
The international publishing landscape is currently undergoing a drastic shift towards Open 
Science practices and COVID-19 related research activities are all being made openly 
accessible for a rapid community driven research and assessment effort (Akligoh et al. 2020; 
JOGL COVID19 project1, Open Letter: Contact Tracking and NHSX2). In an opinion piece for 
Financial Times3, Ethiopian Prime Minister and 2019 Nobel Peace Prize laureate Abiy 
Ahmed shed a spotlight on the importance of concerted global efforts to fight the pandemic 
summarizing: “[I]f the virus is not defeated in Africa, it will only bounce back to the rest of the 
world”. The economic and political dimensions which Ahmed focuses on must be grounded 
in sound scientific research - locally unique, while globally connected. Opening research in 
developed economies will thus not be enough, we must in addition support, enhance and 
connect existing pockets of expertise in Open Science on the African continent.  
 
With the current coronavirus pandemic, the urgent need for Open Access to research results 
will increase scientific public domain knowledge to COVID-19 related literature hence 
enabling African researchers to develop African-centered solutions towards combating the 
SARS-CoV 2 virus, while at the same time strengthening the local biomedical resources of 
African countries and increasing their preparedness for future outbreaks. This applies to both 
global and regional levels. Previous virus outbreaks, such as the recent Western African 
Ebola and Zika epidemics, have highlighted the devastating effects of restricted access to 
data and poorly coordinated dissemination pathways4. It is only by removing paywalls, 
increasing digital access to resources, and fostering individual sharing practices that 
coordinated attempts to mitigate the effects of the virus can be successful. This is true not 
only for short-term responses to the health crisis, but also for the longer-term effects on 
African economies, societal facilities and livelihoods of the people across the continent.  
 
Low and middle income countries’ (LMICs) stakeholders have been leading the way with 
Open Access - particularly the Brasilian searchable full-text journal database network 
SciELO (Scientific Electronic Library Online) which is also represented in South Africa5. We 
encourage African stakeholders to foreground existing pockets of expertise. It is important to 
recognize that a coordinated response to information sharing in Africa can rely on a wide 
range of existing structures supporting openness in research and information sharing. 
Indeed, what is needed is draw attention to these existing resources, facilitate connections 
and communication, and address any gaps and shortfalls that such mapping exposes. 
 
To be most effective, African research and innovation stakeholders must  work along 
existing and affordable structures and platforms to ensure that data produced during this 
pandemic meets FAIR data standards, and that any resultant analyses are published in 
Open Access platforms and underlying raw data made available on open data repositories.

Instigating such practices will be beneficial not only for COVID-19 research, but for African 
research as a whole, and will establish further open and collaborative workflows as well as  
publishing mechanisms. Enhancing openness within African scholarship is an existing 
priority on the continent, and a number of key declarations exist to support efforts. These 
include the Dakar Declaration on Open Access Publishing in Africa and the Global South 
(2016)6 and the more recent African Principles for Open Access Scholarly Communication 
(2019)7. These guidelines outline a vision for African open research that addresses the 
following priorities: 
 
●  Federating scholarly ecosystems on the continent from Northern, Central, Eastern, 
Western and Southern Africa and connecting them to the global research ecosystem. 
 
●  Facilitate the amelioration of language barriers esp francophone/anglophone/arabic 
and also African regional and traditional languages. 
 
●  Establish workspaces and sets of technology-enabled tools that are appropriate for 
use in African research contexts to facilitate faster collaboration and equal 
opportunity in access to data and services regardless of location, language and other 
conditions. 
 
●  Interconnect with other initiatives, sources, and relevant projects inside and outside 
Africa both inbound and outbound to maximize Openness and information exchange 
in a seamless way. 
 
The opportunity that the pandemic offers to research as well as action communities such as 
makers, (bio) hackers and governments is to reflect upon systemic changes which have 
been apparent before Corona, and which we now have a real chance to tackle collectively.  
 
 
An African approach to the COVID-19 pandemic 
There is an imperative for a holistic approach to building institutional capacity within the 
higher education and public funded research centres on the continent. Much like the delivery 
of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), the response to the Covid-19 crisis will need 
to be brought about through collective action. International response to date is centred 
around the ability to connect to the populace through media and technology, much of which 
is concentrated in the metropolises of most African countries. The toll to human life and to 
African economies is one that requires a globally joint response on how to best utilise and 
harness resources to support those countries hit the hardest with the specific and diverse 
realities of everyday lives esp. in urban areas (Adegbeye, 2020).

●  Policy makers (municipal, national, regional levels) 
 
On March 18, AfricArXiv launched a decentralized crowdsourcing effort for resources around 
COVID-19 in a pan-African context8. On March 26, 2020, The African Academy of Sciences 
(AAS) convened a webinar9 for African and non-African experts to kick-start a common 
thinking towards defining a research agenda for the COVID19 outbreak & provide a 
concerted science-based effort for combating this pandemic in Africa. Both initiatives agree 
that the approach must be inclusive of serving and protecting all Africans, i.e. also vulnerable 
and marginalized groups such as orphans, Internally displaced people (IDP) and refugees. A 
theoretical approach of inclusive innovation was described by McPhee et al. (2018) from 
traditional approach of inclusiveness and be sure that we consider African in its 
contemporaneity. 
 
Indigenous and traditional knowledge 
In most African countries, the use of traditional medicines is commonplace amongst 
communities. Traditional medicines are often used in conjunction with, or in replacement of, 
allopathic medicines. Coordinated COVID-19 responses in Africa thus depend on traditional 
health practitioners, allopathic health practitioners and government guidelines providing a 
consistent message. In particular, councils for traditional healers must be brought into 
COVID-19 discussions of national COVID-19 responses. 
Research on traditional medicines and indigenous knowledge systems is on the rise in many 
African institutions, and these expert researchers can act as a valuable conduit between 
traditional health practitioners, governments and the national health systems (REF).  
In a number of African countries, collaboration between health provision communities is 
already emerging. For example, Traditional Health Practitioners (THPs) in South Africa offer 
a coordinated position on COVID-19 and discourage false and misleading claims of about 
powers to cure or knowing how to cure or treat coronavirus (Covid-19)10. Examples of such 
practice should be widely shared for information and best practice. 
It is also important that the hard-won protection of indigenous knowledge (as evidenced in 
the CARE principles) is not overridden by the urgency of the COVID-19 response. In 
particular, research in areas tangentially connected to COVID-19, health and well-being 
must continue to be protected. For example, the projects to promote the sustainable 
production and utilization of African indigenous vegetables for nutrition security and poverty 
reduction (Abukutsa-Onyango, 2019). African researchers are well-placed to continually 
scrutinize research in these areas to preserve data protection, ethics and respectful re-use 
of indiegnous and traditional knowledge.  
 
Importantly, these areas require scrutiny within and between African and international 
research communities and advocacy organisations (e.g. The Indigenous Peoples of Africa 
Coordinating Committee, IPACC11) on all levels. Many international research units have

Havemann, Bezuidenhout et al. (2020). Harnessing the Open Science infrastructure for an efficient African response to COVID-19 [preprint] 
 
long-standing collaborations with African communities, and such contacts can also be 
leveraged towards connecting in all areas to facilitate optimal discussion and collaboration, 
ensuring the implementation of CARE principles12, adherence to the UN Declaration on the 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP13) as well as addressing ‘Intellectual Property Issues 
in Cultural Heritage’ (IPinCH project)14 .  
 
International collaboration 
An additional priority of both science governance and funders is to support South-South 
collaboration. Such collaborations can facilitate best practice sharing and mutual learning so 
as to identify feasible pathways and operation modes across Africa, and through exchange 
of knowledge and expertise between Africa, Latin-Amercia, and South-East Asia. There are 
already good examples of successful practice transfer, such as the adaption of the Latin 
American Open Access publishing organisation SciELO for South Africa15.  
There has also been considerable support by funders for African-led projects and networks 
that strengthen research capacity. Such examples include the African Open Science 
Platform (funded by the National Research Council of South Africa) and the Alliance for 
Accelerating Excellence in Science in Africa (AESA - partnership of African Academy of 
Sciences (AAS), New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) Agency with US$5.5 
million in initial seed funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Wellcome Trust 
and the UK Department for International Development (DFID)). These funders provide 
important sources not only of funds for future infrastructural development, but also expertise, 
and contacts to international expertise and national/regional governance stakeholders. 
 
A range of other stakeholders also exist within the African research ecosystem that already 
work towards facilitating openness. If properly connected it is possible that these digital tools 
and stakeholders can already contribute significantly towards achieving the aspirations 
outlined in the declarations above. Global networks and initiatives such as JOGL16 or GIG17 
have in recent years gathered tremendous experience in facilitating and managing global 
communities of practice beyond the provision of databases and repositories.  
Nonetheless, for South-South collaborations to flourish, more effort needs to be put into 
facilitating cultures of openness, sharing and regional collaboration. This has been widely 
recognized as a priority for African research (REF). Developing mutual trust between 
community members from different countries, languages, and cultures in addition to 
developing technical capacities is one of the most pressing challenges for the global open 
science community right now. Any approach must consider community management, the 
development of onboarding measures, as well as means to connect the African open 
science community to other relevant stakeholders. Examples from existing communities, 
such as H3Africa and MalariaGen, as well as the emerging DELTAS programmes will 
provide helpful resources and roadmaps towards collaborative research practices.

As we are learning from other world regions who are about two weeks ahead with 
coronavirus incubation times, immediate and directly related  research & innovation activities 
must include the thorough assessment of assessing the current infection rate and statistical 
analysis on infection, deaths, and recovery on local, national, regional and pan-African levels 
as well as investigation of socio-economic impacts not only directly related to infection rates 
but taking into consideration all levels of society and future scenarios.

Havemann, Bezuidenhout et al. (2020). Harnessing the Open Science infrastructure for an efficient African response to COVID-19 [preprint] 
 
Most if not all of the stakeholders have already geared up for a thoughtful  and dedicated 
COVID-19 response. It is important that instead of acting in silos we coordinate strategies 
and approaches across countries, stakeholders, language barriers and sectors of societies.  
 
Collaborating on hardware development for medical supplies 
Collaboratively developing hardware internationally has its own specific challenges. These 
guidelines are designed to help new collaborations avoid common pitfalls. This section is 
particularly aimed at researchers in the Global North that are looking to help design 
hardware that can be built and used in Africa 
 
1.  Form collaborations between makers, health professionals and end users to 
understand the environment where the hardware will be used. This is essential for 
forming appropriate specifications. Local collaborators will likely have experience with 
similar devices and will know how well they work in the local environment. Consider 
the availability of supporting infrastructure (does your ventilator require a fixed 
oxygen supply?), consider the ambient conditions (what is the working temperature 
range of the hardware?), or the reliability of the local electricity supply. Over the 
course of the last two years, the Horizon2020 open project Careables18 has gained 
much experience in such collaborations between different stakeholders and offers a 
database of existing solutions as well as support for documentation.  
 
2.  Form collaborations for local manufacturing/repair to better understand how much of 
the design can be built and repaired locally. Local manufacturing and repair is 
essential to improving the availability and up-time of any hardware. Replacement 
parts must be sourced or produced locally for local manufacturing and repair to work 
efficiently. It is worth noting that low-cost/readily-available components in Europe or 
America does not necessarily correlate with what is low-cost/readily-available locally. 
For this reason it is essential to involve local collaborators from the first prototyping 
stages. 
 
3.  Consider the speed of international supply chains. Work with local collaborators to 
understand the lead times for purchasing equipment internationally. The speed and 
reliability of global supply chains varies significantly by region. Do not assume that 
because a part can make it from a factory in another continent to your laboratory in a 
few days that it can reach your collaborators at the same time. Test the supply chains 
where possible even if a small supply can be sent directly between collaborators. The 
scarcity or lack of research equipment can partially be compensated by leveraging 
Open Source Hardware, repair and upcycling of what is available (Maia Chagas et 
al., 2019). 
 
4.  Co-build and collaboratively vet prototypes. While it may seem like a duplication of 
effort to build prototypes concurrently in multiple locations it allows all relevant 
partners to be involved with the design. It also allows for early identification issues 
that may be faced during local production. Collaborative vetting  of prototypes, as has

Havemann, Bezuidenhout et al. (2020). Harnessing the Open Science infrastructure for an efficient African response to COVID-19 [preprint] 
 
been done within the JOGL Covid19 Project, is a useful global endeavor to support 
local manufacturing of those designs which have proven to be most useful in different 
contexts. 
 
The Research Workflow in an African context 
In the following section, we are breaking down the general research workflow to make 
specific suggestions to each step from Discovery, Analysis (including project planning, 
methodology, data generation, results analysis), writing and publishing. 
 
 
 
Discoverability of relevant research literature  
Most academic publishers have made COVID-19 relevant research accessible by 
(temporarily!) waiving subscription fees. 
 
Web of Science and Scopus are not representing the global bulk research output (Tennant 
et al., 2019). Unfortunately, ongoing design challenges can mean that literature in English 
that is published in journals listed in international databases (such as DOAJ) are 
foregrounded. This is particularly true for small, regional African journals that do not have the 
capacity to host their full content online. This can mean that African Research outputs are 
difficult to find and access. 
 
It is recognized that a key means of offsetting the lack of visibility for African research is to 
strengthen the role that digital repositories play in the African research landscape. To date, 
the visibility, interconnectivity and searchability of these repositories has varied enormously. 
Mapping the repository landscape and plotting interconnections is thus vital. A recent 
page 8 of 20 

Havemann, Bezuidenhout et al. (2020). Harnessing the Open Science infrastructure for an efficient African response to COVID-19 [preprint] 
 
contribution to this has been the publication of a dynamic dataset of African digital research 
repositories with an interactive visual map (Bezuidenhout, Havemann, Kitchen, De Mutiis, & 
Owango, 2020). Such resources must be curated and expanded to provide up-to-date 
information on this important network for data sharing.  
 
It is also important that the emerging African repository ecosystem continue to engage with 
international experts, such as the Re3data community to ensure that their design and 
practice meets international standards and facilitates interoperability. In addition to 
supporting repositories, more effort must be made to build capacity in data sharing and open 
access amongst the African research community. Support in digital literacy training is thus a 
vital element of an evolving Open Science landscape. A datasheet of online courses that 
foster digital literacy should be produced and curated. Efforts should be made to translate 
content into key languages such as English, French, Swahili and Arabic. 
 
Digital tools for Science that are suitable for low-resourced settings / Based on REF 
In recent years there has been a rapid expansion of online tools that facilitate various stages 
of the research lifecycle. The uptake of these tools in Africa has, however, been limited. It is 
likely that this is due to a range of different issues, including awareness, research traditions, 
language, infrastructural challenges and design-related issues. It is important that African

Agile Remote Collaboration 
All collaborative knowledge work benefits from utilizing an agile approach, which offers the 
added benefit that it is relatively easy to practice with remote teams as well.  
Source: https://www.leanovate.de/training/scrum/   
 
At its core, agile product development involves frequent feedback processes and cyclical 
(iterative) action at all levels: in the actual doing, at the team level, and in management. 
Agile approaches appreciate that complex product development cannot be planned in 
advance in detail, as the requirements will most probably change during the project lifetime 
and often are not fully understood at the start of the project. 
Instead, the agile approach alternates short planning and development phases. Team 
members agree on goals to be achieved during the respective following sprint, briefly check 
in with each other on a daily basis and review the increments at the end of each sprint. 
Through a methodological retrospective, additional process knowledge can be gained.  
 
Important artefacts of any agile collaboration are: a shared backlog of tasks; a shared task 
board for the following sprint; and regular meetings. It is crucial for agile processes that they 
are facilitated by dedicated roles on two levels, namely the product (e.g. by a product owner) 
and the process level (e.g. by a scrum master or agile coach).

In addition to the above resources, the Coronavirus Tech Handbook19 is a current 
crowdsourced resource of more technologies for remote work. It is important to note that 
agile remote collaboration is a novel form of research organization for many researchers in 
both LMICs and HICs. It would be beneficial for African researchers who have experience in 
this format to provide case studies and examples for further discussion. 
Hardware 
Collaborative hardware design and development is the core methodology of the global 
maker community t. Various tools and databases exist and are widely used to design and 
review designs online, which has already proved beneficial in rapid responses to Covid19. 
Thousands of makers around the globe have started using their 3D printers and laser cutters 
to produce face shields as donations to hospitals and care facilities worldwide, supported by 
the manufacturers of the necessary machines:

DIY Bio and Community Biotechnology 
In addition to the challenges of using digital research tools, African researchers often have to 
contend with shortages of physical research equipment. DIYBio and Community 
biotechnology provide a growing bottom-up approach to research that leverages open 
science and open technologies to drive research and development. This growing community 
movement is key to opening up research output coming from Africa while enabling 
sustainable solution development. Efforts from research groups like the Open Bioeconomy 
Lab20 and its lab nodes in Africa, Hive Biolab21, are developing an open research tool kit to 
enable labs in resource-limited environments and labs in Africa, Asia and Latin Americato 
locally produce research reagents like enzymes that have the capacity for testing for SARS-
CoV 2 virus. 
 
Research Data Management 
The management of COVID-19 data is an international topic, and has seen many influential 
data organizations, such as the Research Data Alliance (RDA) form working groups to 
outline research data management (RDM) practices. These RDM practices consider FAIR 
and CARE principles, but it is vital that African members of these international organizations 
engage in these discussions to ensure that the emerging standards and practices reflect the 
data being generated in Africa. 
 
Mobilizing the engagement of African researchers in RDM discussions will provide a broader 
opportunity to assess current RDM practices, training and infrastructural provision on the 
African continent. This will allow for the evolution of RDM practices that align with 
international practices and reflect the realities of research in Africa. It will also influence the 
design of future data and publishing infrastructures.

It is important to recognise that African institutions rely predominantly on the publication of 
peer-reviewed papers to assess research excellence and define promotion criteria. Such 
systems of assessment are under discussion around the world, but unlikely to change in the 
near future. Thus, the need for African researchers to publish peer-reviewed papers in 
internationally-recognized journals must be respected. Nonetheless, it is possible that the 
use of innovative publishing models, such as peer review being done on a preprint level via 
services like hypothes.is and peercommunityin.org, may streamline this publication.

setting collaborative projects, such as keeping citizens informed in multiple languages by 
sharing consistent translated messages across social networks (Bezuidenhout et al, 2020). 
 
Public engagement and science journalism is a small, but emerging field within Africa. While 
there remain challenges associated with low science literacy and historic lack of 
engagement between academia and the public, there have been many positive recent 
changes. It is vital that researchers continue to engage with the public to prevent 
misinformation and to provide up-to-date information about both local and international 
research. For this, further collaborations with African journalists to improve public access to 
research is key.  
Reaching all citizens demands the catering for language diversity24 via journalistic 
approaches as addressed by the African Science Literacy Network in Nigeria25, e.g. via 
video messaging and dissemination of key information as provided by the WHO via social 
networks, as suggested by Bezuidenhout, McNaughton & Havemann (2020) or Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) approaches like "Wash your hands" in 500+ languages26. 
 
Improving Visibility of African Research  
Interoperability is a key element in scientific and research communication. Information 
flowstream should be reliable to build sustainable research and academic infrastructure. 
Linking research works to different academic research platforms is defining interoperability 
and supporting discoverability across disciplines, borders and time.  
A range of different African organizations are already engaged with these issues. In 
particular, the data-intensive research/high-performance computing institutions (such as 
DIRISA in South Africa) are developing considerable expertise in data sharing and 
interoperable research platforms. Such institutions are supported by both national and 
international funding and expertise, and represent an important resource for the emerging 
Open Science infrastructure in Africa. 
 
Moreover, a number of independent organizations, such as  AfricArXiv and similar pre-prints 
repositories are also assisting efforts to facilitate information sharing across platforms. With 
the support of Africa Open Access network partners, AfricArXiv provides an important 
resource for African researchers. Starting from the ORCID authentication and permission to 
read the researcher’s contribution to the distribution through other platforms and channels as 
per Zenodo.

(Open) Educational Resources 
There is already a long history of distance and online learning in Africa. For example the 
University of South Africa, founded in 1946, is one of the oldest and largest distance learning 
institutions in the world. Moreover, centres such as the Centre for Innovation of Teaching 
and Learning at the University of Cape Town, provide globally-recognized expertise in digital 
learning. Similar activities are hosted by institutions and platforms both nationally and on a 
continental level (https://oerafrica.org/). Mapping existing expertise in these areas will 
provide valuable resources for the expansion of OER in Africa. Moreover, collecting advice 
documents for the use of OER/digital learning tools in low-resourced settings (such as the 
one by UCT27) will provide useful resources. 
 
The eLearning Africa Report 2019 lists 55 African countries with examples and capacities for 
ICT for education (country profiles), many of which can also be utilized during the research 
workflow from project development to publication of the results (Elletson and Stromeyer, 
2019).  
 
Financial sustainability  
Optimizing immediate finances 
In order to facilitate the evolution of an open infrastructure for COVID-19 response, it is vital 
that funds are found to facilitate coordination. There are many ways in which these funds 
could be sourced, including: 
●  Consolidate for overlapping activities  
●  Identify current projects and active funders addressing infrastructural reform (and 
form open database) 
●  Curate a list of open grant calls to co-apply to 
●  Approach intern/national funders and governments directly 
 
Long-term financial sustainability 
The coordination of open infrastructures in Africa will have benefits for African research far 
beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. Ensuring long-term financial sustainability to support the 
maintenance of structures emerging from the current crisis, and identifying new stakeholders 
to assist with the evolution, will be key. Issues to address will be: 
●  Gather evidence on the COVID-19-induced coordination and the impact of these 
open infrastructures

Havemann, Bezuidenhout et al. (2020). Harnessing the Open Science infrastructure for an efficient African response to COVID-19 [preprint] 
 
●  Continue to lobby for a bare minimum of 1% GDP for research from national 
governments, and ensure that steadily increasing investing in research 
infrastructures is at the foreground 
●  Critically assess national policies on data sharing and research to effect change that 
will support open infrastructures 
●  Engage with funding councils to ensure that Open Science infrastructures are on 
their agenda 
●  Call for international collaboration from the global Open Science community 
●  Identify funding models, or viable business models that work for and with the African 
research community.  We propose a transparent and mixed funding model, inclusive 
of: 
➔  pan-African: African Union, AfDB, … 
➔  African national governments (R&E ministries) 
➔  national research societies such as ASSAf (SA) and SRF (Sudan) 
➔  African foundations such as Mandela / Mo Ibrahim / … 
➔  Subsidized by international support via B&M Gates Foundation, Chan-
Zuckerberg Initiative, Mozilla Foundation, Sloan Foundation, etc.   
➔  USAID; European funding agencies: (UK) Wellcome Trust; (GER) DFG, Max 
Planck / Leibniz / Helmholtz Society, DAAD; (FR) CNRS; (SWE) SIDA 
➔  Scholarly services: translations, Science Communication to the general public 
(simplifying academic slang), capacity building training for scientists, ECR 
and students // who pays for what service? 
 
 
Limitations & challenges 
Discussions on long-term financing of Open Science infrastructures need to be specific 
about who benefits from research results being shared openly early in the process, and what 
formats properly facilitate this. There is an urgent need to restructure the finance system of 
who pays for what and when. Scholarly literature and data repositories should be an integral 
part of the research process; but who pays for the operations/handling, DOI allocation, data 
hosting etc. at what level in the process? 
 
Beware of sanctioned countries and what impact that might have on the national research 
landscape: Bezuidenhout et al (2019). The lack of reliable, affordable, fast internet 
connectivity still poses the biggest challenge to any attempts of online collaboration in many 
parts of the African continent.  
 
Outlook 
We call for partnership building and collaboration across the continent and with international 
support from other world regions and donor countries.
