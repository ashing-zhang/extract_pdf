1.2 SOP Summary 
 
Title  
 
 
Chlorophyll fluorescence 
 
 
Brief description  
 
 
Light energy absorbed by chlorophyll molecules in a leaf can undergo one of three fates:  
•  used to drive photosynthesis (photochemistry);  
•  excess energy can be dissipated as heat;  
•  re‐emitted as light—chlorophyll fluorescence.  
Βy  measuring  the  yield  of  chlorophyll  fluorescence,  information  about  changes  in  the 
efficiency of photochemistry and heat dissipation can be gained. This is due to the fact that 
light energy absorbed by chlorophyll molecules can either used to drive photosynthesis or the 
excess energy can be dissipated as heat or it can be re-emitted as chlorophyll fluorescence 
(taken from Maxwell et al., 2000). 
  
Non-photochemical quenching is the quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence and is thought to 
be  involved  in  protecting  the  photosynthetic  machinery  against  over-excitation  and 
subsequent damage.

  Chlorophyll Fluorescence 
   
   
 
 
 
2 Protocol Steps  
 
Light-adapted and dark-adapted measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence are conducted using a 
pulse amplitude modulated leaf chamber fluorometer (Li-6400, Li-Cor, Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA).  
 
•  Randomly  select  four  plants  from  each  treatment  for  chlorophyll  fluorescence 
measurements. Use the most recently fully expanded leaf for measurement.  
•  Calibrate the system prior to measurement. 
 
 
•  To obtain minimal fluorescence values in the dark-adapted state (F ), apply a low-intensity 
o
red measuring light source (630 nm). 
•  To  obtain  maximal  fluorescence  values  (F ),  apply  a  saturating  light  pulse  of 
m
8000 μmol m−2 s−1.  
•  Calculate maximum quantum use efficiency of PSII in the dark-adapted state using the 
following equation:  
 
F /F  = (F  − F ) / F  
v m m o m
   
•  The leaf area assayed is dark-adapted for at least 15 min prior to F /F  measurements.  
v m
 
 
•  In a similar manner, obtain minimum (F′’ ) and maximum (F′’ ) values of fluorescence in the 
o m
light-adapted state at 800 μmol m−2 s−1.  
•  After continuously illuminating leaves with actinic light for 6 min, record the steady-state 
fluorescence (F ).  
s
•  Using these parameters, calculate the following ratios: 
Effective quantum use efficiency of PSII in the light-adapted state: 
 
F′’ /F′’ =(F′’ −F′’ )/F′’  
v m m o m
 
 
Effective quantum yield: 
Φ =(F′’ −F )/F′’  
PSII m s m
 
 
Photochemical quenching: 
q =(F′’ −F )/F′’ −F′’  
P m s m o
