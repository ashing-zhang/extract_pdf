1.  Progress of the research performed in the PhD project and key scientific results  
Due to the Covid-19 pandemic in UK and due to the March start of this PhD, only desk based tasks have 
commenced. A literature review is currently being undertaken on the role of wild birds in dissemination and 
persistence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in the farm environment. The review includes sections on 
identifying the current situation regarding AMR in different environments; what is currently known about wild 
birds in relation to carriage and dissemination of AMR; and evaluation of different methodologies for identifying 
AMR, both by phenotype and genotype, in bacteria. 
 
Due to Covid-19 restrictions we have not been able to recruit outdoor farms for this study. Hence, faecal 
samples have not been collected or processed from pigs or wild birds present on farm. However, some 
historical E. coli isolated from gull faeces, collected from an outdoor pig farm, during a longitudinal study in the 
Oh-EJP project ARDIG are being considered for inclusion in this PhD project as a result of the delays caused by 
COVID-19. Further to this an opportunity has presented itself for examining the role of corvids in disseminating 
AMR on a pig farm, which is currently being pursued. 
 
A poster was submitted to the OHEJP ASM 2020 meeting, and an oral presentation on the PhD was presented 
virtually in the 3MT competition for the OHEJP AGM 2020, as part of communicating their research. The student 
also took part in a workshop at University of Surrey on microbiomes in order to learn from other institutes 
taking part in metagenomic research, which may be included later on in the WILBR project. The student has also 
attended the One Health EJP Summer School on Global One Health and the EJP FULL FORCE Plasmid Analysis 
workshop in order to further develop their skill set for tasks later on in the project.

4.  Impact & relevance  
The supervisory team brings together leading experts in veterinary, wildlife and environmental AMR, with 
expertise spanning veterinary and molecular microbiology, bioinformatics, microbial ecology and evolution, 
as well as wildlife disease. 
William Gaze is working with the United Nations Environment Project on AMR in the environment, having 
recently authored the UNEP Frontiers report on AMR and the environment. He is currently located within 
two interdisciplinary units, Exeter’s Centre for Environment and Human health, and the Environmental and 
Sustainability Institute, which is also part of the University of Exeter 
Beside his work as a researcher within SVA, Stefan Börjesson is involved in the Swedish AMR monitoring 
program and is also a senior lecturer in clinical microbiology with an emphasis on AMR in a One-health 
perspective at Linköping University at the Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine. 
Muna Anjum leads the Bacterial Characterisation Workgroup and is the AMR Research Lead at the APHA 
working at the interface of molecular and veterinary microbiology, within the One Health remit. As lead for 
the AMR research, she is also involved in supporting national AMR surveillance activities and APHA’s 
response to national outbreaks, and identifying new and emerging threats. She is a member of the DEFRA 
Antimicrobial Resistance Coordination Group, which advises and reviews the DEFRA activities on 
antimicrobial usage in animals and AMR in microorganisms from feedstuffs, animals and food, the APHA 
lead for the Defra AMR in the Environment group, and works closely with colleagues in Public Health 
England in various research projects and national activities.

Comments: 
The project has been delayed by COVID-19 as the student by this point should have been recruiting farms in 
preparation for longitudinal sampling. The recruitment and sampling have both been delayed and if these 
restrictions persist it may have a major impact on the proposed PhD. The original plan was to sample across five 
time points in three years, (2x first year, 2x second year, 1 x third year) but this is unlikely to happen as a result 
of COVID-19. A new estimated completion date is hard to predict, as it is reliant on external factors, such as 
lockdown restrictions being lifted to allow access to the farms.
