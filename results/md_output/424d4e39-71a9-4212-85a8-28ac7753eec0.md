DOI | Digital Object Identifier   
The  digital  object  identifier  (DOI)  system  originated  in  a  joint  initiative  of  three  trade 
associations  in  the  publishing  industry  (International  Publishers  Association;  International 
Association  of  Scientific,  Technical  and  Medical  Publishers;  Association  of  American 
Publishers). The system was announced at the Frankfurt Book Fair 1997. The International 
DOI Foundation (IDF) was created to develop and manage the DOI system, also in 1997. The 
DOI  system  was  adopted  as  International  Standard  ISO  26324  in  2012.  The  DOI  system 
implements the Handle System and adds a number of new features. The DOI system provides 
an infrastructure for persistent unique identification of objects of any type. The DOI system is 
designed  to  work  over  the  Internet.  A  DOI  name  is  permanently  assigned  to  an  object  to 
provide  a  resolvable  persistent  network  link  to  current  information  about  that  object, 
including  where  the  object,  or  information  about  it,  can  be  found  on  the  Internet.  While 
information about an object can change over time, its DOI name will not change. A DOI name 
can be resolved within the DOI system to values of one or more types of data relating to the 
object identified by that DOI name, such as a URL, an e-mail address, other identifiers and 
descriptive  metadata.  The  DOI  system  enables  the  construction  of  automated  services  and 
transactions.  Applications  of  the  DOI  system  include  but  are  not  limited  to  managing 
information  and  documentation  location  and  access;  managing  metadata;  facilitating 
electronic  transactions;  persistent  unique  identification  of  any  form  of  any  data;  and 
commercial and non-commercial transactions. The content of an object associated with a DOI 
name  is  described  unambiguously  by  DOI  metadata,  based on  a  structured extensible  data 
model  that  enables  the  object  to  be  associated  with  metadata  of  any  desired  degree  of 
precision  and  granularity  to  support  description  and  services.  The  data  model  supports 
interoperability  between  DOI  applications.  The  scope  of  the  DOI  system  is  not  defined  by

URI  |  Uniform  Resource  Identifier 
 
URI is a string that provides a unique address (either on the Internet or on another private 
network, such as a computer filesystem or an Intranet) representing a resource, and implicitly 
describes  where  a  resource  can  be  found.  A  resource  identification  need  not  suggest  the 
retrieval of resource representations over the Internet, nor need they imply network-based 
resources at all.

EML  |  Ecological  Metadata  Language 
 
The Ecological Metadata Language (EML) metadata standard was originally developed for 
the  earth,  environmental  and  ecological  sciences.  It  is  based  on  prior  work  done  by  the 
Ecological Society of America and associated efforts. It has been developed to document any 
research  data,  and  as  such  can  be  used  outside  of  these  original  subject  areas.  EML  is 
implemented as a series of XML document types that can by used in a modular and extensible 
manner to document ecological data. Each EML module is designed to describe one logical 
part of the total metadata that should be included with any ecological dataset.

referred to as HTTP over TLS, or HTTP over SSL.

the files are organized.

DwC-A | Darwin Core Archive   
DwC-A is a biodiversity informatics data standard that makes use of the Darwin Core terms to 
produce  a  single,  self  contained  dataset  for  sharing  species-level  (taxonomic),  species-
occurrence data, and sampling-event data. An archive is a set of text files, in standard comma- 
or tab-delimited format, with a simple descriptor file (called meta.xml) to inform others how 
the files are organized.

JSON | JavaScript Object Notation   
JavaScript  Object  Notation  (JSON)  is  a  lightweight,  text-based,  language-independent  data 
interchange format. It was derived from the ECMAScript Programming Language Standard. 
JSON defines a small set of formatting rules for the portable representation of structured data. 
This RFC specification aims to remove inconsistencies with other specifications of JSON, repair 
specification errors, and offer experience-based interoperability guidance.

EML  |  Ecological  Metadata  Language 
 
The Ecological Metadata Language (EML) metadata standard was originally developed for 
the  earth,  environmental  and  ecological  sciences.  It  is  based  on  prior  work  done  by  the 
Ecological Society of America and associated efforts. It has been developed to document any 
research  data,  and  as  such  can  be  used  outside  of  these  original  subject  areas.  EML  is 
implemented as a series of XML document types that can by used in a modular and extensible 
manner to document ecological data. Each EML module is designed to describe one logical 
part of the total metadata that should be included with any ecological dataset.

DwC | Darwin Core   
Darwin  Core  (DwC)  is  a  vocabulary  that  includes  a  glossary  of terms  (in  other contexts 
these  might  be  called  properties,  elements,  fields,  columns,  attributes,  or  concepts) 
intended  to  facilitate  the  sharing  of  information  about  biological  diversity  by  providing 
identifiers, labels, and definitions. The Darwin Core is primarily based on the observation, 
specimen and samples of taxa. The Darwin Core standard is comprised of one vocabulary 
(the  Darwin  Core  vocabulary),  and  six  associated  documents.  The  vocabulary  itself  is 
composed of four term lists: Darwin Core terms borrowed from the Dublin Core legacy and 
terms  namespace,  Darwin  Core  IRI-value  Term  Analogs,  and  the  core  terms  defined  by 
Darwin Core.

PROV-O | W3C PROV Ontology   
The PROV Ontology (PROV-O) expresses the PROV Data Model using the OWL2 Web Ontology 
Language  (OWL2).  It  is  intended  for  the  Linked  Data  and  Semantic  Web  community.  It 
provides  a  set  of  classes,  properties,  and  restrictions  that  can  be  used  to  represent  and 
interchange  provenance  information  generated  in  different  systems  and  under  different 
contexts. It can also be specialized to create new classes and properties to model provenance 
information for different applications and domains. PROV-O is one serialization of PROV-DM, 
the other two being PROV-N and PROV-XML. PROV-DM and PROV-O define how to represent 
provenance on the World Wide Web, and as such additional documentation has been included 
in  this  record  for PROV-AQ  (Access  and  Query),  a  note  which  describes  how  standard  web 
protocols may be used to locate, retrieve and query provenance records. PROV-DC provides a 
mapping  from  Dublin  Core  to  PROV-O,  and  is  listed  in  this  record.  For  the  purpose of  this 
specification, provenance is defined as a record that describes the people, institutions, entities, 
and activities involved in producing, influencing, or delivering a piece of data or a thing. In 
particular, the provenance of information is crucial in deciding whether information is to be 
trusted, how it should be integrated with other diverse information sources, and how to give 
credit to its originators when reusing it. In an open and inclusive environment such as the Web, 
where users find information that is often contradictory or questionable, provenance can help 
those users to make trust judgements.
