Abstract 
Life on Earth is sustained by complex interactions between organisms and their environment. These 
biotic interactions can be captured in datasets and published digitally. We describe a review process 
of such an openly accessible digital interactions dataset of known origin, and discuss their outcome. 
The dataset under review (aka globalbioticinteractions/hivetracks2023) has size 84.2KiB and 
contains 1 interaction with 1 unique type of association (e.g., pollinatedBy) between 1 primary taxon 
(e.g., Trifolium repens) and 1 associated taxon (e.g., Apis mellifera ligustica). The report includes 
detailed summaries of interactions data as well as a taxonomic review from multiple catalogs.

Introduction 
Data Review 
Data review can be a time consuming process, especially when done manually. This 
review report aims to help facilitate data review of species interaction claims made 
in datasets registered with Global Biotic Interactions (Poelen, Simons, and Mungall 
2014). The review includes summary statistics of, and observations about, the 
dataset under review:

For additional metadata related to this dataset, please visit 
https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/hivetracks2023 and inspect associated 
metadata files including, but not limited to, README.md, eml.xml, and/or globi.json. 
Methods 
The review is performed through programmatic scripts that leverage tools like 
Preston, Elton, Nomer combined with third-party tools like grep, mlr, tail and head.

elton review globalbioticinteractions/hivetracks2023), extract interaction claims 
(e.g., elton interactions globalbioticinteractions/hivetracks2023), or list taxonomic 
names (e.g., elton names globalbioticinteractions/hivetracks2023)

Biotic Interaction Data Model 
 
2 Disclaimer: The results in this review should be considered friendly, yet naive, 
notes from an unsophisticated robot. Please keep that in mind when considering the 
review results. 

In this review, biotic interactions (or biotic associations) are modeled as a primary 
(aka subject, source) organism interacting with an associate (aka object, target) 
organism. The dataset under review classified the primary/associate organisms 
with specific taxa. The primary and associate organisms The kind of interaction is 
documented as an interaction type. 
The dataset under review (aka globalbioticinteractions/hivetracks2023) has size 
84.2KiB and contains 1 interaction with 1 unique type of association (e.g., 
pollinatedBy) between 1 primary taxon (e.g., Trifolium repens) and 1 associated 
taxon (e.g., Apis mellifera ligustica). 
An exhaustive list of indexed interaction claims can be found in csv and tsv archives. 
To facilitate discovery, the first 500 claims available on the html page at indexed-
interactions.html are shown below. 
The exhaustive list was used to create the following data summaries below.

website. 
Taxonomic Alignment 
As part of the review, all names are aligned against various name catalogs (e.g., col, 
ncbi, discoverlife, gbif, itis, globi, mdd, tpt, and pbdb). These alignments may serve 
as a way to review name usage or aid in selecting of a suitable taxonomic name 
resource to use. 
Sample of Name Alignments

Distribution of Taxonomic Ranks of Aligned Names by Catalog. Names that were not 
aligned with a catalog are counted as NAs. So, the total number of unaligned names 
for a catalog will be listed in their NA row.

Name relationship types per catalog. Name relationship type “NONE” means that a 
name was not recognized by the associated catalog. “SAME_AS” indicates either a 
“HAS_ACCEPTED_NAME” or “SYNONYM_OF” name relationship type. We recognize 
that “SYNONYM_OF” encompasses many types of nomenclatural synonymies (ICZN 
1999) (e.g., junior synonym, senior synonyms).

Additional Reviews 
Elton, Nomer, and other tools may have difficulties interpreting existing species 
interaction datasets. Or, they may misbehave, or otherwise show unexpected 
behavior. As part of the review process, detailed review notes are kept that 
document possibly misbehaving, or confused, review bots. An sample of review 
notes associated with this review can be found below.

GloBI Review Badge 
As part of the review, a review badge is generated. This review badge can be 
included in webpages to indicate the review status of the dataset under review. 

 
Picture of a GloBI Review Badge 3 
Note that if the badge is green, no review notes were generated. If the badge is 
yellow, the review bots may need some help with interpreting the species 
interaction data. 
GloBI Index Badge 
If the dataset under review has been registered with GloBI, and has been succesfully 
indexed by GloBI, the GloBI Index Status Badge will turn green. This means that the 
dataset under review was indexed by GloBI and is available through GloBI services 
and derived data products.

Discussion 
This review is intended to provide a perspective on the dataset to aid understanding 
of species interaction claims discovered. However, this review should not be 
considered as fitness of use or other kind of quality assessment. Instead, the review 
may be used as in indication of the open-ness6 and FAIRness (Wilkinson et al. 2016; 
Trekels et al. 2023) of the dataset: in order to perform this review, the data was 
likely openly available, Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable. Currently, 
this Open-FAIR assessment is qualitative, and with measurement units specified, a 
more quantitative approach can be implemented.

/datasets) 
6 According to http://opendefinition.org/: “Open data is data that can be freely used, 
re-used and redistributed by anyone - subject only, at most, to the requirement to 
attribute and sharealike.” 

This report also showcases the reuse of machine-actionable (meta)data, something 
highly recommended by the FAIR Data Principles (Wilkinson et al. 2016). Making 
(meta)data machine-actionable means that it can be more precisely processed by 
computers, enabling even naive review bots like Nomer and Elton to interpret the 
data effectively. This capability is crucial for not just automating the generation of 
reports, but also to facilitate seamless data exchanges, i.e., interoperability.
