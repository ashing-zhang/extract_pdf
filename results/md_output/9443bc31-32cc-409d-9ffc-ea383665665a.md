Abstract
The paper considers the integral Volterra equations of the first kind
which are related to the inverse boundary-value heat conduction prob-
lem. The algorithms have been developed to numerically solve the
respective integral equations, which are based on the midpoint rule
and product integration method.
1 Problem statement
Let us consider the following inverse boundary-value problem
u = u , x ∈ (0,1), t > 0, (1)
t xx
with boundary conditions
u(x,0) = 0, u(0,t) = 0, u (0,t) = g (t), x ∈ (0,1), t > 0. (2)
x
It is necessary to find a boundary value of the function
u(1,t) = φ(t), t > 0. (3)
2+η
Let g ∈ C at T > 0, η ∈ (0,1) and there exist constants M > 0,
[0,T]
m ≥ 0 such that |g(t)| ≤ Memt for t ∈ [0,T].
At g(t) = g (t) there exists an accurate solution to u(1,t) = φ (t).
0 0
Let us consider the case where instead of g (t) we know some approx-
0
imations of g (t) and an error level δ > 0 such that kg − g k 6 δ.

The uniqueness of the solution to problem (1) — (3) is proved in [1].
To solve (1) — (3) we use the approach from [2], based on the direct
and inverse Laplace transform, supposing that there exist constants
C > 0 and β > 0 for which |φ(t)| 6 Ceβ0t holds for ∀x ∈ [0,1],

To understand the specific features of the integral Volterra equation
of the first kind (5), (6) it is useful to consider the Volterra kernels
K ∈ C , ∆ = {t,s/0 ≤ s ≤ t ≤ T} at fixed values of N. Table 1

Introduce a uniform mesh t = ih, t = (i − 1)h, i = 1,n,
i i− 21 2
nh = T. Table 1 and Figure 1 show that the parameter N from (6)
affects the choice of the mesh spacing h. Consider for sufficiently small
h the algorithms for numerically solving the Volterra equations of the
first kind (5), (6) which are based on the self-regularizing feature of
the discretization procedure [4], [5]. The midpoint rule and product
integration method are used as ”basic” ones. The product integration
method is particularly effective, if K(t) is a strongly oscillating function
[6]. Such a choice can be explained by the simplicity of the algorithm
and calculation of an approximated solution with an error of order
O(h2), in the case the initial data are not perturbed.
Solve (5), (6) by the midpoint rule. Approximate the integral in
(5) by the sum. To calculate φ(t), we will obtain the equation with
respect to φh at the (i − 1)-th node. Denote the mesh function of

3 Computational experiment results
Computational experiments were made with single precision. Let us
specify N = 2, 4 so, that K (0.0468) = 0, K (0.0292) = 0. The

calculation results for the case studies from [2] are:
1. φ (t) = te−t, t ∈ [0,1],

2. φ (t) = e−t sin10πt, t ∈ [0,1].

When calculating φh with respect to (7) and (9), we use a mesh

method, respectively. The Tables show that both difference methods
have the convergence order O(h2).

cedure we will set a saw-tooth perturbance of the right-hand side of

4 Conclusion
The paper considers the inverse boundary-value problem of heat con-
duction with a constant boundary. The problem is solved by the ap-
proach based on the direct and inverse Laplace transform. This made
it possible to obtain the Volterra equation of the first kind of a special
form, which characterizes an explicit relationship between the desired
boundary function and the initial data on the other boundary. The
algorithms have been developed to numerically solve the respective
integral equations, on the basis of the midpoint rule and product in-
tegration method. The parameters determining the discretization in-
terval were identified. The series of test calculations were made. The
computational experiment shows that the numerical methods have the
second order of convergence with respect to mesh spacing, and are
self-regularizing under the perturbed initial data in metric C.
