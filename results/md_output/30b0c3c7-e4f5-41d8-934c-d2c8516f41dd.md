ROBINS-I tool (Stage II): For each study

Design  Individually randomized / Cluster randomized / Matched (e.g. cross-over) 
Participants  Workers exposed to asbestos 
Experimental intervention  PPE

Is your aim for this study…? 
X  to assess the effect of assignment to intervention 
  to assess the effect of starting and adhering to intervention 
 
Specify the outcome 
Specify which outcome is being assessed for risk of bias (typically from among those earmarked for the Summary of Findings table). Specify whether this is a proposed benefit 
or harm of intervention. 
Benefit: a lower level of asbestos exposure in the inhaled air 
 
Specify the numerical result being assessed 
In case of multiple alternative analyses being presented, specify the numeric result (e.g. RR = 1.52 (95% CI 0.83 to 2.77) and/or a reference (e.g. to a table, figure or paragraph) 
that uniquely defines the result being assessed.

Preliminary consideration of confounders 
Complete a row for each important confounding domain (i) listed in the review protocol; and (ii) relevant to the setting of this particular study, or which the study authors 
identified as potentially important. 
“Important” confounding domains are those for which, in the context of this study, adjustment is expected to lead to a clinically important change in the estimated effect of the 
intervention. “Validity” refers to whether the confounding variable or variables fully measure the domain, while “reliability” refers to the precision of the measurement (more 
measurement error means less reliability).

* In the context of a particular study, variables can be demonstrated not to be confounders and so not included in the analysis: (a) if they are not predictive of the outcome; (b) if they are not predictive of intervention; or (c) because 
   
adjustment makes no or minimal difference to the estimated effect of the primary parameter. Note that “no statistically significant association” is not the same as “not predictive”.
