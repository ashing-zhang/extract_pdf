Figure A.1. A step-by-step description of the procedure (see text for description of Figure). 
LOI/Consent: Participants arrived in the room where they read a deceptive Letter of 
Information. 
Characteristics/Mood 1: Participants, in individual rooms, completed the characteristics 
questionnaire, the PHQ-9, and the VAMP (Mood, Time 1). 
Relationship Closeness Induction Task (RCIT): Back in the group room, participants were 
instructed to get to know each other using the RCIT, a list of 29 questions that become 
progressively more personal over time. This task strengthened the impact of the subsequent 
exclusion manipulations and promoted rumination. 
Ranking: Back in their individual rooms, Participants were given instructions to list, in order of 
preference, the names of two participants they wished to work with for an anticipated partner 
task. These rankings were disregarded.  
Manipulation: Participants were randomly assigned to either the Inclusion group or the 
Exclusion group. 
Cyberball: In their individual rooms, participants engaged in the online ball-tossing game 
(believing it was happening in real time with the other participants. However, the game was pre-
programmed: participants in the Inclusion group received a fair distribution of tosses throughout 
the game; participants in the Exclusion group received far less.  

  2 
False Feedback: After playing Cyberball, all participants in the Exclusion group were given 
false feedback that they were no one’s first or second choice and would therefore be transferred 
to the “Solo” mode of playing. In contrast, all participants in the Inclusion group were moved to 
the “Solo” mode of playing under the pretense that a participant (the confederate) had to leave.  
Mood 2: All participants completed the VAMP for a second time (Mood, Time 2).  
Writing: Participants engaged in a 25-minute writing task that asked them to anonymously 
reflect on their experiences, thoughts, and feelings regarding the online Cyberball game. Fifteen 
minutes into writing, participants filled out the final VAMP (Mood, Time 3), before resuming 
the writing task for 10 more minutes. 
Dual-Interference Task: Participants were given 10 minutes to complete the RAPM while 
tasked with remembering a list of words. The five words were either priming words related to 
exclusion (P) or neutral words (N). Given the Inclusion (I) or Exclusion (E) groups, the design 
for this paradigm has four conditions: IP, IN, EP, EN.  
Debrief: Refer to Appendix J.

*While rates of medication use for depression and anxiety are doubled between groups, the 
results of a t-test reveal that they are not significantly different. Regardless, all analyses were re-
run controlling for medication use and our results did not change. Furthermore, the unbalanced 
distribution of White and South Asian participants between groups was noted; all analyses were 
re-run while controlling for these two ethnicities and, again, our results did not change.

How to score the writing:  
•  Read the definitions of each construct and use your best judgement  
 
 
•  If you read a sentence and find evidence for level 1 self-blame and then later find 
evidence for level 3 self-blame in the same piece, score the entire piece as level 3 self 
blame.  
o  Do this for each construct such that the highest level is the score for that 
piece 
o  Here’s another example: If you find evidence for both level 1 and level 2 self-
blame then score everything as level 2 for self-blame. 
 
 
 
•  The examples below are not an exhaustive list for each level. They’re types of 
sentences that should definitely be categorized as belonging to the level they’re listed 
under, but there may be sentences that belong to that level that I didn’t list. 
 
 
•  Use the examples below as a guide to get a feeling for the kinds of things you might 
encounter in each level and how to interpret some of the writing you will read. 
 
 
•  These categories are not mutually exclusive. For example, it is possible for a piece to 
be scored as level 3 for self-blame and level 3 for low self-esteem at the same time.

Pilot Discussion 
Participants in the Exclusion group reported a significant increase in sadness, one of the 
symptoms of depression, but they did not report any significant changes in happiness, anxiety, or 
calmness. The fact that anxiety did not change suggests that the paradigm may have some 
specificity; despite frequently co-occurring with depression, anxiety is not a symptom of 
depression. On the other hand, if our paradigm was effective at triggering the syndrome of 
depression, participants in the Exclusion group should have experienced a significant decrease in 
happiness (representing anhedonia); however, the decrease in their reported happiness was not 
statistically significant.  
In this experiment, we did not compare the effects of our paradigm on those having and 
those lacking a previous history of psychopathology. Moreover, our sample consisted only of 
female participants. We utilized female participants for two reasons: (1) it was an initial 
investigation with a relatively small sample size and, considering that psychology student pools 
are well-known to have a female bias, we did not want our findings to be confounded by sex 
gender; and (2) because of the sex and gender differences in depression, female participants were 
of greater theoretical importance. We therefore conducted a follow-up experiment with a larger 
sample size to investigate the replicability of these findings, to investigate additional symptoms, 
and to investigate the effects of sex and a previous history of depression or anxiety.

Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) Results 
 
We tried to corroborate the self-reported mood results by analyzing the emotional content 
of the participants’ writings with the LIWC program. As shown in Table 4, participants in the 
Exclusion group used words that were significantly more negative than participants in the 
Inclusion group. In the LIWC program, Negative Emotion is comprised of sadness, anger, and 
anxiety. Since a significant effect was only found for sadness, the increase in Negative 
Emotionality can be attributed to sadness, rather than anger or anxiety. Thus, the LIWC results 
corroborate the self-report sadness and anxiety mood results.

Debriefing 
 
1) Outline of the Debriefing Process 
 
Probe for suspicion: Participants were asked leading questions to determine whether they caught 
on to the deceptive nature of the study. 
For each of the following steps, the experimenter ensured that participants had multiple 
opportunities to ask questions and request clarification. Furthermore, throughout these next steps, 
the experimenter repeatedly asked the participant how they were feeling.  
Reveal experimental manipulations: The experimenter subsequently revealed the deceptive 
nature of the study by going through, step-by-step, every experimental manipulation and how 
they worked. For participants in the Exclusion condition, the experimenter assured them on at 
least three separate occasions that, at no point, were they excluded by the other participants in the 
study.  
Explanation: All participants were provided with the rationale behind the study and the 
experimental manipulations employed. Citing evolutionary literature and existing studies, the 
participant was led to understand the purpose behind the study.  
Consent Form: Participants signed a second consent form for the experimenters to use their data, 
now that the full scope of the study was made known to them. Participants were given the 
opportunity to withdraw their data from the study. 
Mental Health Forms and Call Backs: Participants were provided with a sheet of mental health 
resources and asked if they would like to be called by an experimenter in a few days for a brief 
check-up.  
Walk Out: Participants randomly assigned to our exclusion condition were walked out of the 
building and offered an opportunity for the experimenter to walk with them to the 
_____________, should they wish to go there.  
Debriefing Process Duration 
The debriefing process for these studies differed between conditions. For participants in our 
Inclusion (control) condition, the process typically lasted about 5-10 minutes; for participants in 
our Exclusion condition, the process typically lasted about 15 minutes. These times are for each 
participant. 
2) Safety Provisions 
 
PHQ-9 Provision 

  22 
Within the Letter of Information, under the subheading ‘questionnaires’, are the following 
sentences: 
“Please note that if you report having suicidal thoughts in the PHQ-9, you will lose 
confidentiality and anonymity with respect to this one question. After the study is complete, a 
researcher who has not had contact with you will check your answers to the suicide question in 
the PHQ-9. If you report having suicidal thoughts, your name and phone number will be placed 
in a sealed envelope with your Student ID written on the outside of the envelope. A researcher 
who has not had contact with you will bring the sealed envelope to Dr. ______ . Dr. _______ 
will provide your name and phone number to the _______ so that you may be anonymously 
contacted by a counsellor. If Dr. ________ is unavailable, then Dr. Paul Andrews will break 
confidentiality to ensure the ________ is notified. Please note that if you are currently 
experiencing suicidal thoughts, and you would like to anonymously request help from the 
_______, you may do so by indicating this on the suicide question of the PHQ-9”. 
Confederate Provision 
This study involves four participants engaging in the Relationship Closeness Induction Task. 
One or two of the participants in each session is a confederate working with the lab. Their role is 
two-fold: to ensure the conversation maintains its momentum by providing answers to each 
question of their own; and more importantly, to critically listen to the answers of the other 
participants and notify the experimenter if any details are shared that imply a pre-existing history 
with depression, social rejection, or severe symptoms related to mental health. Should the 
confederate notify the experimenter, the experimenter will ensure that a participant who has been 
randomly assigned to the Exclusion condition will be removed from the study and not experience 
the subsequent experimental manipulations.  
Writing Provision 
All writings provided by participants, within 72 hours of their submission, were investigated for 
the presence of a list of keywords related to self-harm and suicide. Should any of these words 
appear, the protocol for the PHQ-9 Provision would be followed. 
Mental Health Sheet Provision 
All participants enrolled in the study, after being debriefed, were presented with a list of a dozen 
relevant mental health services, both on and off campus. Participants randomly assigned to the 
exclusion condition were offered on multiple occasions after the debriefing process.  
Call-Back Provision 
All participants enrolled in the study, after being debriefed, were offered an opportunity to be 
called by an experimenter a few days after the completion of the study. The purposes of this 
phone call would be to check up on them. Notably, this opportunity was offered verbally by the 
experimenter, and provided on paper along with their second consent form; thus, should a 
participant want a call, but not feel comfortable verbalizing their request, they could still write it 

  23 
down. Participants randomly assigned to the exclusion condition were offered a call-back on 
multiple occasions after the debriefing process.  
3) Debriefing Prototype Script 
 
The beginning of the debriefing process begins with a semi-structured series of questions to 
probe for the mood of the participant and suspicion. Each line beginning with a dash represents 
a question and, depending on the answer, may necessitate the addition of further questions. 
Suspicion Probe 
-So how do you feel about the experiment overall?  
-Do you have any questions?  
-How are you feeling right now?  
-Let’s look at it chronologically: how did you find meeting everyone?  
-How did you find Cyberball?  
-[If Exclusion]: So, I noticed that the ratio of passes seemed a bit off; I was wondering how you 
felt about that? 
-[If Exclusion]: Even though we have a provision for this scenario, we do have to ask how you 
felt about being moved into the solo condition. How did that make you feel? 
-How was the writing portion? Of course, it is anonymous, so I am mostly asking how you felt 
about the exercise and if there was any part of it you wanted to discuss? 
-How did you find the RAPM puzzles at the end? 
-Alright, all that is left is for me to debrief you on the study, and you will be on your way. Does 
that sound good? 
The following is an attempt to replicate the way in which the experimenter naturally revealed the 
nature of the study to the participant. Experimenters took care to provide space for the 
participant, at any moment, to interrupt and ask a question. 
This experiment involved a significant amount of deception, meaning that the premise you were 
brought here under is not what the experiment was about. You were told that the purpose of the 
experiment was to look at the effects of mental visualization on social co-operation, mood, and 
problem solving; however, this study was actually about the effects of depressed cognition and 
sad mood on causal thinking. As I go through the experiment step by step, this will become 
clearer. 
You were told participants were randomly assigned to a ‘teamwork’ or ‘solo’ condition. In your 
case, you began in the teamwork condition and were later moved to the solo condition. The truth 
is, everyone is assigned to the teamwork condition, and everyone is subsequently transferred into 

  24 
the solo condition. The real conditions are called ‘Inclusion’: our control group (explain what 
control group means, if they do not know); and ‘Exclusion’: our experimental manipulation. 
These conditions dictated the way in which this transition from the ‘team’ to ‘solo’ condition 
took place.  
Here are the two main differences between the conditions. While playing Cyber-ball, you 
believed you were playing with the other participants; however, you were really playing a 
preprogrammed computer simulation. Those in the inclusion condition played a game 
programmed to pass to them a fair and equal number of times; and those in the exclusion played 
a game programmed to pass to them significantly less than the others.  
Additionally, I told you to rank the top two people you wanted to work with. Those in the 
‘Inclusion’ condition were told that a participant misunderstood the time restraints of the study 
and therefore had to leave, meaning that the odd number of participants left over would have to 
move to the solo condition. Those in the ‘Exclusion’ condition were told that no one wanted to 
work with you, and as your selections did not match up with any of the other participants, you 
would be moved to the solo condition. The truth is, I threw out everyone’s selections as soon as I 
received them from you. 
[For Exclusion]: To clarify, what this means is that at NO point during this experiment were you 
socially excluded by any of the other participants. Any time where you felt that you were 
excluded was a result of our experimental manipulation. In fact, every single one of the 
participants here experienced the same experimental manipulation you did and are likely feeling 
similar to how you do right now. 
I recognize that I have yet to explain the rationale behind the study, but I wanted to take a 
moment first to ask you how you’re feeling?  
[For Exclusion]: I also want to stress that it is very common for people to still feel bad, even 
after hearing they were never actually excluded, because in the moment, those negative emotions 
were real. How do you feel? 
Now, as I said, all the participants were in the same condition as yourself, but there is one 
exception. One of the participants today was actually a confederate working with the lab (explain 
what a confederate means if participant does not know). Out of curiosity, can you guess who the 
Confederate was? 
Now I will explain the rationale behind the study: 
What follows is a casual explanation of the rationale behind our study. All participants were 
given a more detailed debriefing form to take home with them: that form can be found below.  
The theories behind our study are rooted in evolutionary psychology: namely, that certain painful 
emotions and feelings, evolved for some reason. Evolutionary psychology suggests that there 
may be a certain utility to these emotions. For example, fear prevents us from getting into 
dangerous situations; without anxiety we would never look both ways when we cross the street, 
or double check our doors before we leave our houses; without jealousy, infidelity would be far 

  25 
more common. Essentially, we believe the same applies to depression. Now, to clarify, we are 
not talking about the condition diagnosed as Major Depressive Disorder.  
Evidence suggests that those who are experiencing depression seem to be able to engage in 
higher levels of analysis. On a biological level, it appears that resources are re-allocated to parts 
of the brain dedicated to analyzing and ruminating on exceptionally challenging problems, some 
of which do not have an immediate answer. Often, in those experiencing depression, we see 
appetite and pleasure-seeking traded in for ruminative thoughts about a difficult subject causing 
significant distress, and in the cases where these subjects are resolved, the depressed individual 
experiences a notable improvement in their mood. For example, let’s say a person found out they 
are being cheated on by their partner. This individual will often be angry at their partner for what 
they have done, yet will experience depression as they ruminate on exceptionally difficult 
questions like: What do I do now? Do I break up with them? What does this mean about me? 
In this experiment, we have manufactured a reason for sadness: social exclusion. This experience 
of social exclusion intended to prompt a practically unanswerable question: Why was I 
excluded? Furthermore, the guided conversation you participated in served to strengthen the 
effects of the manufactured social exclusion by getting you to reveal personal information about 
yourself. During the writing section of the experiment, we expected people who had been 
excluded to try and understand why they had been excluded, and they would think about what 
they had said during the guided conversation to try and find those reasons.  
During the writing part of the experiment, we expected that participants who had been excluded 
would try to understand why they had been excluded, and that this is a form of causal thinking.  
 what we refer to as: causal analysis. Causal analysis can take the form of root cause analysis, 
involving questions like: Why did this happen? Is it something I said? Was it because of this or 
that?; and counterfactual thoughts, involving ruminative statements like: if only I had done this, 
or if only I had not done that.  
We evaluated your mood multiple times throughout the experiment so that we could see how 
your mood changed after the exclusion.  
Finally, I wanted to touch on those problem-solving tasks you completed at the end. The purpose 
of this was to see how social exclusion affects your ability to problem solve. We hypothesized 
that the negative mood caused by exclusion would make it more difficult for you to solve these 
problems. The rationale behind this hypothesis is that, while you are working on these problems 
that require a lot of your working memory, typically referred to as Type II processing, you are 
also ruminating about your experience of social exclusion. Considering working memory is a 
finite resource, we believe those assigned to our exclusion condition will perform worse. 
(We expected that if you were excluded, you would be thinking about your exclusion and that it 
would interfere with your ability to solve these problems).  
I know that this is a lot of information to take in. Do you have any questions? 

  26 
[Exclusion] I just want to reiterate once again, that at no point were you actually excluded. 
Everyone here today, besides our confederate(s), experienced the same manipulation. It is a 
powerful experimental paradigm and, while we believe the goal of our experiment is an 
important one, it is still important to me that you let me know how you are feeling. As I said 
earlier, it is very common to still have negative feelings associated with the study lingering after 
the debrief. How are you? 
Well, on that note, all that is left is for you to sign some forms and you can be on your way.  
First, we have a debrief form, just outlining the details of our study further. You can take this 
home. 
Second, we need you to sign a re-consent form for us to use your data, as the consent form you 
initially signed was done so without knowing the full scope of the study. Your participation at 
this point is still voluntary, if you wish to withdraw your data, just mark it on the sheet.  
Third, I have here a form for us to contact you in a few days. This form, which is optional, is one 
we encourage you to sign if you are still not feeling well as a result of this study.  
Finally, I have here a list of mental health resources for you to have if you need any sort of 
support either now or in the future. I will leave you for a minute or two to sign. 
The experimenter leaves the room so the participant feels comfortable to sign what they feel 
comfortable signing.  
Thank you so much for participating. Your SONA credits will be updated. It was great meeting 
you! 
Do you know how to get out from here? (Participants in the Exclusion condition were offered to 
be walked to the _____________).  
Alright, have a great rest of the semester! 
4) Debrief Form 
 
The following is the debrief form that was physically provided to every participant enrolled in 
our study. 
EMOTIONAL AND COGNITIVE RESPONSES TO SOCIAL COOPERATION TASKS 
Thank  you  for  completing  the  study.  We  greatly  appreciate  your time,  honesty,  and  effort 
towards our research project. We ask that you do not discuss the nature of the study with others 
who may later participate in it, as this could affect the validity of our research conclusions. 
What were we studying? 
This research project investigates the relationship between emotion and cognition. Specifically, it 
tests whether ostracism-induced sadness and subsequent depressive rumination promote causal 

  27 
analysis, avoidant behaviour, and Type II processing in a sample of undergraduate students at 
________.  
At the beginning of the experiment you were asked to complete a battery of questionnaires that 
assessed  a  number  of  cognitive,  emotional,  and  behavioural  measures  including;  depression, 
anxiety, mood-state, analytical rumination, and questions on the complexity of experiences. 
We  also  had  you  participate  in  an  online  ball-tossing  game  called  ‘CyberBall’ after you  had 
answered  personal  questions  about  yourself  in  a  group.  This  group  was  made  up  of  other 
participants, like yourself, and one or two confederates. A confederate is someone who is working 
with the experiment and behaves as if they were a participant to deceive the genuine participants. 
Their role as a confederate was to help create a more powerful simulation of social exclusion. 
Though you believed that you were playing CyberBall against other participants, the game was 
actually  rigged  so  that  you  would  receive  a  certain  number  of  throws,  depending  on  which 
condition you were randomly assigned to (‘Inclusion’ or ‘Exclusion’). In order to accurately assess 
how one responds to experiencing social exclusion, we had to create the illusion that the other 
players were ‘real’ participants and that they threw the ball to you significantly less often than they 
did to other participants. As well, we had to create the illusion that no one selected you as a partner 
for a partner problem-solving task.  
We understand that this deception may make some people feel uncomfortable. Now that you are 
aware of the true nature of the study, you will be given the opportunity to re-consent to keep your 
data included in the study or to withdraw your data from the study without penalty. 
You were also asked to write about your deepest thoughts and feelings towards your experience 
playing  CyberBall.  You  may  be  experiencing  feelings  of  sadness,  worry,  or  other  upsetting 
emotions. It is important for you to know that these types of feelings are very normal, and that 
negative feelings are natural, adaptive reactions to negative situations or problems that happen in 
our day-to-day lives. Although describing negative emotions in a writing task can make people 
feel worse during or right after writing, studies suggest that it actually makes them feel better in 
the long run. However, if your participation in this study has caused you concerns, anxiety, or 
otherwise distressed you, you may contact the ___________ at ________________. We have also 
provided a list of mental health resources and counselling information.  
All of the information that we collected in today’s study is confidential and your responses will 
not be linked to your personal information, except if you report recent or ongoing suicidal thoughts, 
self-harm, intent to commit suicide, criminal activity, or sexual or physical abuse. We are not 
interested in any one individual’s responses; rather, we want to look at the general patterns that 
emerge when the data is aggregated.  
Why are we interested in this? 
Social conflicts can often elicit depressed affect and require us to engage in problem-solving to 
understand, manage, and prevent current and future social problems. A common feature of 
depressed affect is rumination, a repetitive style of thinking that involves focused attention 
towards one’s problems, including the experience, causes, and consequences of the distress. 

  28 
Some  research  suggests  that  rumination  and  depressed  affect  are  associated  with  improved 
problem-solving skills when the task is socially relevant, requires more deliberate and analytical 
processing, and when more realistic assessments are beneficial.  
Our independent variable is whether the participant is included or excluded and our dependent 
variables  are  mood,  causal  analysis,  avoidant  behaviour,  and  Type  II  processing.  We 
hypothesize that those in the Exclusion condition will engage in more casual analysis, trying to 
understand why they were excluded. We are also interested in seeing if there is evidence for 
avoidant coping mechanisms, which involve avoiding painful feelings and distracting oneself 
rather  than  dealing  feelings  directly.  Finally,  we  hypothesize  that  those  in  the  Exclusion 
condition will engage in more Type II processing, which is a slow, effortful style of thinking 
that involves analytical reasoning and working memory. Type II processing is involved in both 
causal analysis and problem-solving, two key aspects of depressive rumination.  
Encouraging ruminative processing through expressive writing tasks has been shown to elicit a 
temporary increase in depressed mood but is associated with a beneficial long-term decrease in 
depression and rumination, potentially by encouraging analytical thinking and social problem-
solving. 
However, there is limited research on the nature of social problem-solving during rumination and 
the role depressed affect has in promoting social problem-solving behaviours. Your participation 
today is greatly appreciated and will help uncover the nature of the relationship between complex 
social  problems  and  depression.  This  research  also  has  the  potential  to  better  delineate 
pathological  depression  from  depressed  affect  and  to  help  inform  treatment  options  for 
individuals experiencing depression.
