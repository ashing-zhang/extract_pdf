SPCRJointDynamics
A bone physics engine for cloth.
Overview
Do you want to simulate cloth in your game with physics? Then this is the plugin for you.
SPCRJointDynamics requires a basic bone setup, and you are good to go.
Support for Unity Engine 2018.2.0f1 and above.

Purpose of development
There was a requirement in one of our games that the skirt of the character should perfectly interact
with the character’s movement.

Specifications
SPCRJointDynamics uses cross simulation algorithm (mass‑spring‑damper model) to animate the
bones in real‑time. For direct use for skirts and hairs, we mainly focused on the overall appearance
rather than the physically accurate behaviors.
Since adding bones is still a manual process in most 3D software, and therefore bones are not always
correctly aligned. To overcome this issue, we made a constraint base plugin.

Advance Preparation
Set scripting runtime version to .Net 4 and check the allow unsafe code.

How to use
Add SPCRJointDynamicsPoint component on all the child / hierarchical bones, which you would like
to be get affected.
Then add SPCRJointDynamicsController component on the root of the character.

Set the parent transform bone in the Parent Transform slot.

able to use.
Here is a simple explanation of those constraints.
Structural vertical → creates vertical bone constraints.
Structural horizontal → creates horizontal bone constraints.
Shear → Creates diagonal bone constraints.
Bending vertical → This will create constraints with every alternate bone in the vertical list.
(Ex. ABC → Bending Vertical [A→C])
Bending Horizontal → This will create constraints with every alternate bone in the horizontal list.
(Ex. ABC → Bending Horizontal [A→C])
From Root Points → Update/Apply selected preset.
Near point automatic search XYZ → Rearrange the points by distance and updates/applies selected
preset.
Near point automatic search XZ → Rearrange the points by distance, ignoring the Y‑axis, and up‑
date/apply selected preset.
Near point automatic search XYZ (Fixed UP) → Rearrange the points by distance, the first and last
bones are fixed. Then updates/applies selected preset.

Constraint length calculation → Recalculates and updates the restraint length. This option is useful
when you move the game object in the Hierarchy.
Adding a collider
SPCRJointDynamics engine uses a special collider component to work with. Please note that this
collider is different from Unity’s built‑in collider.
1. Create a new game object in the scene.
2. Add SPCRJointDynamicsCollider component, by clicking on the Add Component button.
There are two types of colliders SPCRJointDynamicsCollider is having, sphere collider and capsule

collider.
Youcaninterchangethespherecolliderwiththecapsulecolliderandviceversabyusingtheheightof
the collider.
If the height is 0 then SPCRJointDynamics treats it as a sphere collider, and if the height is more than
0 then it will be treated as a capsule collider.
Now select the main game object on which SPCRJointDynamicsController is attached, then add the
collider in the collider array.
