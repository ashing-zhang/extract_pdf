20  Abstract 
21  Two pervious concrete projects (named as SR28 and SR431), with the same mixture design but 
22  different winter maintenance activities, were included in this research. Both projects are located in 
23  the Lake Tahoe area, Nevada, U.S.A. Testing results indicated that the mechanical properties were 
24  significantly higher in SR28 cored samples than the ones in SR431. It was found that the SR28 pieces 
25  have fewer air voids, while the SR431 samples have higher water absorption and hydraulic 
26  conductivity, and the SR28 samples fare better performance against repeated freezing and thawing 
27  cycles than the SR431 ones. SEM pictures of crack surfaces in cores taken from SR28 indicate that 
28  the cement binder phase has been largely retained. However, in the coring sample of SR431, needle-
29  shaped residues can be seen within the cement binder phase and an abundance of precipitated micro-
30  sized crystalized particles can be observed. On a micrometer scale, the μCT examination reveals that 
31  the porosity of SR28 samples is significantly less than that of SR431. The analyzing results give a 
32  clue to demonstrate the durability of pervious concrete pavement can be attributed to the construction 
33  quality control, maintenance activity, or the weather and locations of the field sites. 
34  1  Introduction 
35  Pervious concrete pavement is a powerful method for mitigating the negative effects of stormwater 
36  runoff on watersheds. Additionally, it benefits urban heat island reduction and groundwater 

37  purification (Xie,.2019a). The open network of pores in pervious concrete pavement reduces the 
38  volume of excess stormwater and improves the quality of water by reducing suspended particles, 
39  overall phosphorus, whole nitrogen, and metals (McCain, 2010). The use of mechanical and 
40  biological systems accomplishes this. Effective air voids may vary from 14 - 31%, permeability can 
41  range from 90 to 2,000 cm/hr, and compressive strength can range from 6-21 MPa (Schaefer, 2006). 
42  Durability is the most significant factor influencing pervious concrete pavement life cycle 
43  performance. Winter road maintenance may significantly impact a pervious concrete installation's 
44  durability and performance. The durability of pervious concrete may also be affected by seasonal 
45  freeze-thaw cycles brought on by deicers. When utilizing pervious concrete, a few additional 
46  concerns need to be addressed. To provide suitable in-place material qualities, proper mixing and 
47  installation are required. Large void spaces severely impact the mechanical characteristics of 
48  pervious concrete. Infiltration capacity, mechanical features, and durability of pervious concrete 
49  pavements must thus be kept in a proper balance. 
50  Saturated freeze-thaw performance (as can be measured by ASTM C666) can be enhanced through 
51  various changes to the design of the mixture, as found by Schaefer et al. (Schaefer 2006). These 
52  include the use of a reduced cementitious material content, the inclusion of polypropylene fibers, the 
53  use of a higher water/cement ratio, an increase in concrete strength, and the inclusion of entrained air 
54  (Kevern, 2008). The addition of polypropylene fibers, silica fume, or a larger cementitious material, 
55  according to Yang (2011), significantly increased saturated freeze-thaw endurance, especially for 
56  water-cured samples. According to the ASTM C666, while structural characteristics were not 
57  considerably different, fluent pervious concrete samples measured for freeze-thaw resistance showed 
58  much superior endurance than either clogged or saturated models (Guthrie, 2010). It was found that 
59  the recycled carbon fiber composite scraps from the aerospace industry with large aspect ratios can 
60  be used as a replacement for natural coarse aggregate in low-porosity pervious concrete. Mechanical 
61  and durability assessment results show that the mechanical properties increased with increasing 
62  recycled fibers due to the bridging mechanism. After rapid freeze-thaw cycling and deicer chemical 
63  attacking assessment, the fiber-reinforced pervious concrete maintained over 95% of the original 
64  mass and about 80% of the dynamic modulus after experiencing over 200 cycles (Nassiri, 2021). 
65  Steel fiber is also appropriate to reinforce the pervious concrete. It was pointed out that pervious 
66  concrete with 2% steel fiber has a compressive strength of 52.8 MPa at the age of 28 days (Lee, 
67  2022). Basalt fiber and glass fiber are also good options to reinforce the pervious concrete. By adding 
68  a small amount of basalt fiber, the mechanical properties of the pervious concrete can be significantly 
69  enhanced (Wu, 2022), and the flexural strength of pervious concrete can increase by about 5% with 
70  even 0.3% of glass fiber (Singh, 2022). 
71  The durability of the pervious concrete road is also greatly impacted by the use of deicers during 
72  winter maintenance operations, in addition to freeze-thaw degradation. The U.S. Environmental 
73  Protection Agency (EPA) demonstrates that the pervious concrete pavements cannot be treated with 
74  traction sand. Also, lower deicer application rates are advised. Even though several studies have 
75  proved that the use of deicers may increase anti-icing effectiveness, snow, and ice management 
76  operations continue to provide distinct issues for pervious concrete pavement. Calcium magnesium 
77  acetate, potassium acetate, or magnesium chloride deicers should not be used on pervious concrete 
78  pavement, according to the recent edition of the NRMCA Pervious Concrete Pavement Maintenance 
79  and Operations Guide. The freeze-thaw deterioration, mass loss, properties deterioration, and 
80  dynamic elastic modulus attenuation of pervious concrete under freeze-thaw cycles were 
81  investigated. The results indicated that the pervious concrete deteriorates water and salt freeze-thaw 
82  cycling and the defects between the paste and aggregate interface increased with the increase in 
2

83  freeze-thaw cycles (Xiang, 2022). Although the consensus has been reached that the deicers harm the 
84  pervious concrete, a well-accepted test method to assess the durability of pervious concrete with 
85  exposure to freeze-thaw cycling along with deicing salts is still lacking (Cutler, 2010). By comparing 
86  several commonly used deicers, the order of the caustic deicers is NaCl, CaCl , MgCl , potassium 
2 2
87  acetate, sodium acetate, and calcium-magnesium acetate (Tsang, 2016). Apart from the types of 
88  deicing salts, the impact of salt concentration on the durability of pervious concrete has been 
89  investigated. It was found that the mass-loss rate, relative dynamic modulus of elasticity, mechanical 
90  properties, and hydraulic conductivity after 300 freeze-thaw cycles varies significantly with various 
91  salt concentrations. The most severe freeze-thaw damage of the samples was those immersed in a 3% 
92  NaCl solution, while no observable damage in a 20% of NaCl solution (Feng, 2020). Unlike the 
93  statement of this study, it was claimed by several studies that the impact of MgCl  on the durability 
2
94  of concrete has been considerably underestimated. It was claimed that the Mg2+ will react with the C-
95  S-H binder phase in cement hydration products to form an amorphous M-S-H phase, CaCl , brucite, 
2
96  oxychlorides, and Mg (OH) Cl∙4(H O) phases (Xie, 2019b).  
3 5 2  
97  Further elucidating the influence of various deicers on pervious concrete pavements, under a freeze-
98  thaw or dry-wet environment, Culter et al. (2010) made two pervious concrete mixtures (modified 
99  and unmodified latex). Tests were done with three deicers. Meanwhile, both the saturated and drained 
100  techniques of applying deicer were used. The greatest harm was observed to be done by calcium 
101  chloride solution, which contradicts the NRMCA Pervious Concrete Pavement Maintenance and 
102  Operations Guide. In contrast, calcium magnesium acetate was the least harmful. Comparing the 
103  results to a revised, more accurate drained test procedure, the saturated scaling measure technique 
104  (ASTM C672) caused a substantially more extensive loss of concrete mass. Results from the soaked 
105  and drained experiments showed that, regardless of the kind of deicer, wet curing samples using latex 
106  materials showed considerably greater loss of mass than concrete that did not contain the latex 
107  polymer. 
108  Different blends of pervious concrete pavement have varying levels of durability. Construction of a 
109  pervious concrete pavement is essential for obtaining desired performance. The laboratory tests 
110  replicated several years of experience in operation and gave information on properties and durability 
111  without requiring field installation findings. It made use of current studies to fill in a knowledge gap 
112  for using pervious concrete roads in cooler environments, which present special difficulties. 
113  Laboratory permeability testing on pervious concrete samples is commonly done. Falling head 
114  permeability tests are the most used laboratory testing (Schaefer, 2006; McCain, 2010; Rizvi, 2010; 
115  Huang, 2010). In this test, the sides of the concrete samples were sealed, and the time required for 
116  water supplied to the sample's surface to decrease in height was measured. To calculate the hydraulic 
117  conductivity, the time, and the initial and final pressure heads were utilized. 
118  To comply with federal (EPA) regulations, the Nevada Department of Transportation (NDOT) 
119  requires helpful measures to minimize the number of fine silt created by NDOT. The most efficient 
120  approach for eliminating fine particles is infiltration. Pervious concrete pavement replaces 
121  impermeable areas to minimize runoff and spread infiltration. In the summer of 2012, NDOT 
122  constructed two pervious concrete pavement projects near Lake Tahoe, named as SR28 and SR431. 
123  During the winter months, de-icing compounds such as salt was applied to the asphalt highway 
124  surfaces near both of these two project locations. Maintenance activities such as street sweeping and 
125  vacuuming were performed by NDOT maintenance crews within the project area. Snow plows and 
126  snow removal equipment with tire chains have subjected the slabs to greater load weights as well as 
127  cracking. In light of the same mixture design specifications and similar maintenance activities, the 
3 
 

128  durability of the pervious concrete pavements in these two sites is expected to be the same. However, 
129  the forensic observation demonstrated that the SR28 site has better durability compared with the 
130  SR431 site. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the reasons that lead to the evident different 
131  performances of these two sites. 
132  It was believed that there are several potential reasons which can lead to the durability difference 
133  between these two sites: 1) the construction quality control; 2) the maintenance activity; and 3) the 
134  weather and locations of the field sites. First, for the construction quality control, some parameters 
135  should be analyzed in detail such as the mix design, the shapes and quality of the aggregates, the 
136  vibration process, the local water/binder ratio, and the quantity of additives. Second, for the effect of 
137  the maintenance activities, the types and quantity of the deicing chemicals usage, and the cleaning 
138  approaches should be systematically investigated. Finally, the effects of the external conditions such 
139  as weather and locations of the field sites, the precipitations, the real local freeze/thaw cycling times, 
140  and the traffic loadings must be considered carefully. Although many researchers have reported the 
141  effects of the above-mentioned factors on the durability of concrete pavements; however, little study 
142  has statistically reported the influence of these factors on the durability of pervious concrete 
143  pavement. Collecting all the information mentioned above will be a big step forward to finding out 
144  the influence factors on the durability performance and help to realize a durable pervious concrete 
145  pavement. This study set out to determine how well pervious concrete controls the quantity and 
146  quality of drainage systems in areas often subjected to snow plowing and de-icing salt materials, 
147  which will benefit the analysis of the effectiveness and resilience of pervious concrete. 
148  2  Experimental  
149  2.1  Materials and mixtures 
150  The samples were named the SR28 and the SR431, and two slabs of pervious concrete were installed 
151  in Incline Village, Nevada (Lake Tahoe). These two locations, SR431 and SR28, were coring 
152  locations for conducting tests. The combined scale of the pervious concrete investigated is 
153  demonstrated in Table 1. The ratio of water to cement is 0.3. Nevada II was used in the study as the 
154  cement, and the specific gravity of the aggregate was 2.64.  
155  Under ASTM C143, C1688, C39, and C496, the density, slump, air void content, and strength of 
156  samples were determined. Table 2 displays the slump of concrete as 0.64 cm. The compressive 
157  strength and tensile strength at 7d were 19.1 and 2.1 MPa, and the compressive strength and tensile 
158  strength at 28d were 23.0 and 2.2 MPa, respectively.

161  Pervious concrete road has been tested in the field, and the soil drainage and road design (such as a 
162  steep slope) were examined and noted. The infiltration was computed using the following formula:

168  The coring locations were positioned at varying distances from the pavement edge throughout the test 
169  sites. In addition, cores were obtained from places with different degrees of suffering (limited,

171  utilized in two measurements of assessing the engineering qualities of the built and tested specimens. 
172  Given that the majority of this deterioration is caused by moisture entering the concrete, a concrete's

175  determine the pervious concrete samples' durability. Drainage testing was used to determine the 
176  infiltration rate during performance tests. The damaged cores were used to analyze the concrete's 
177  microstructure. A micro-computed X-ray tomography(CT) and scanning electron microscope 
178  (SEM) device were utilized to analyze the microstructure of samples in this work. Detailed 
179  experimental procedures are described below. 
180  2.2.1 Compressive strength 
181  Due to the lack of an official standard for pervious concrete, the performance of the concrete's 
182  compressive strength was evaluated based on ASTM C39, with the following modifications: A height 
183  of eight inches was hacked from cores with a ratio of diameter to height of 0.5, and then permitted 
184  with 24 hours drying. 
185  The suggested ASTM C617 standard was followed while covering the cores with cement to provide a 
186  smooth surface for the sample. The cement paste had a water-to-powder ratio of 0.3. The 
187  combination contained 1% by mass of water reducer after a relatively tiny addition of the reducer. 
188  The mixture was applied using the sample's flat end, covering the sample's whole surface with 
189  around 4 mm of the sample. To maintain the cement capping's integrity inside the core's boundaries, 
190  excess cement paste had to be removed. The cap surface was checked to make sure it was parallel to 
191  the axis of the cylindrical sample using a set of levels.  Before proceeding with the other end of the 
192  sample, six hours were given for the cement to cure. 
193  Six height measurements were taken of each sample after the cement tops had cured. After that, the 
194  cores were broken apart by being vertically crushed at a rate of 200 kg per second. For each 
195  specimen, the enormous force required to produce failure was measured and documented.

2.2.2 Splitting tensile strength 
196  In terms of ASTM C496 testing standard, the performance of the splitting tensile strength was 
197  evaluated. The sample was divided into cores with a diameter-height ratio of 0.5 and an eight-inch 
198  height. The cores were left to cure for twenty-four hours. 
199  By the ASTM 617 standard, the compression test was performed after the tensile strength had been 
200  measured using a cement strip that had been installed down the whole length of each sample's 
6

201  opposing edges to provide level, parallel, and stable surfaces. However, two opposing strips of 
202  cement matrix were put throughout the whole length of the specimens. The paste's liquid-to-cement 
203  content was 0.3. It was necessary to add only enough water reducer to the mixture to make it contain 
204  1% by mass of reducer. A strip of sample about 4 mm thick was placed on the edge of the core 
205  cement sample such that it ran the whole length of the sample. After six hours of setting time, the 
206  cement was applied to the other side. Throughout the procedure, a series of standards were utilized to 
207  guarantee the sample remained horizontal to the same diameter and parallel to each other. 
208   After being cured, the six heights of each cement sample were measured. Following the failure at 60 
209  kg/s, the cores were crushed along their diameter. For each sample, the highest force applied to 
210  achieve loss was recorded. Figure 2 depicts the sample pictures for the strength testing results. 
   
Fig. 2. Splitting tensile strength test process 
211  2.2.3 Density, voids, and absorption 
212  Following ASTM C1754, the Density, and void percentage were measured. To provide a more 
213  consistent height throughout a particular group of cement samples, the cores were prepped by having 
214  their rough edges sawed off. 
215  The density of the cement samples was assessed by using calipers through testing the diameter and 
216  length. Each sample's dry mass was determined using the following drying procedure. Before putting 
217  the sample into a 100° c oven for 24 hours to dry, its mass was defined. Repeat the procedure until 
218  the reported mass change for each sample is less than 0.5% before the drying. Measure the mass of 
219  the samples once again after dried 1day. After two dryings, this condition is satisfied. 
220  Calculate the testing density with the after equation, using the synthetic mass of each concrete sample 
221  along with the mean length and diameter values: 
𝑲 × 𝑨
222  𝐃𝐞𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐭𝐲 =

223  where: 
224  A = the dry mass

225  D = the average diameter  
226  L = the average length  
227  K = 1,273,240  
228  The next step was to weigh each sample suspended in a water bath, which allowed us to determine its 
229  submerged mass. To hang the sample, secure a rope through a wooden pin to the middle of the 
230  sample and put it around the tub's rim. Each sample spent 30 minutes in the water bath before being 
231  slapped with a hammer to remove the remaining bubbles. Then, the mass immersed in the water and 
232  its temperature was documented. The following calculation was used to compute the void content as 
233  a percent

238  ASTM C642 was utilized to determine the water absorption rate. Each sample's dry mass was 
239  recorded and immersed in water for 24 hours. After being taken out of the water, the sample's 
240  exposed surfaces were dried off and allowed to drain. Before being put in the water for another 24 
241  hours, the sample's mass was measured again. This process was performed several times until the 
242  sample mass change was less than 0.5% of the preceding time. The following equation was used to 
243  determine the water absorption： 
(𝑩 − 𝑨)
244  𝐀𝐛𝐬𝐨𝐫𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 (%) =  × 𝟏𝟎𝟎%

245  where: 
246  A = the initial dry mass  
247  B = the final mass   
248   
249  2.2.4 Abrasion resistance 
250  The ASTM C1747 was used to determine the abrasion resistance. Every cement sample was air-dried 
251  for 36 hours after being cut to 4 inches. When the samples were dried, their masses were tested.  
252  A collection of three samples from the same site SR28 were tested using a 30-rpm, 500-rpm Los 
253  Angeles abrasion testing machine. A 1-inch sieve was used to sort the complete result, and the kept 
254  material was recorded. The identical procedure was subsequently applied to three samples from 
255  position SR431. 
256  2.2.5 Water permeability  
257  Recently, without any accepted standards for determining water permeability in pervious concrete. 
258  To determine the speed of water seeping pervious concrete, past researchers have successfully 
259  modified a dropping head permeameter. The approach utilized is identical to previous studies 
260  (Schaefer, 2006; McCain, 2010; Rizvi, 2010; Huang, 2010). 
261  Each sample from each sampling point was subjected to a falling head test. Test specimens were 
262  trimmed to the height is four inches. Only the bottom and top sides of the samples could pass water 
263  through them since the total size of the cylinder was sealed with silicone.

265  inspired the design of the standpipe. Each standpipe required the cutting of three pipe pieces: a length 
266  of 51 centimeters (20 inches) for the top standpipe tube and two portions measuring 10.2 cm in 
267  length. The bottom drainage reservoir was made out of one of the 10.2 cm components. The other 
268  10.2 cm section included the specimen. 
269  Water came out of a hole with a radius of 1.55 cm in the bottom of the PVC. The pipe's bottom was 
270  sealed with silicone sealant. Drill a hole with a radius of 5.1 in the center of another plastic plate. The 
271  second plate was hit with four holes in the four outer quadrants. After that, to align the second plate 
272  with the pipe's 10.2 cm opening, it was secured to the head of the lower piece of PVC. 
273  Close to the bottom, a small hole was bored into the top PVC piece. This hole was used to attach a 
274  small, clear plastic pipe that measured the standpipe's water level and was affixed to the outside in a 
275  straight, vertical position. The transparent line was then drawn at one-inch intervals by measurement 
276  from the PVC's bottom to a height of 38.1 cm. The bottom of the top PVC piece was covered with a 
277  plastic plate. 
278  To offer enough flexibility for the insertion of pervious concrete samples, a second 10.2 cm (4 in) 
279  piece of pipe was cut along a single length from top to bottom. Once the sample had been inserted, 
280  silicone was used to seal the pipe's vertical aperture and the boundaries between the sample and pipe 
281  at the top and bottom. Fig. 3 illustrates the preparation work of measuring water permeability. After 
282  that, the sample was placed using spherical plastic spacers between both the top and bottom halves of 
283  the standpipe contraption. The four plastic plate holes were each fastened with a nut and bolt. The 
284  spaces between the sample's top and bottom and the matching equipment part were filled with 
285  silicone.  Figure 4 illustrates the test equipment for water permeability. The device's bottom drain 
286  was plugged with a rubber washer, and the standpipe was filled to just above the 38.1 cm (15 in) 
287  level. The rubber stopper was lifted as the water level dropped by an inch at a time, and a timer with 
288  repeated lap functionality was used to clock the lap.  This procedure was repeated thrice for each 
289  sample.

293  2.2.6 Salt scaling  
294  For testing salt scaling resistance, a drained test technique was utilized. The experiment utilized a 
295  solution containing 3% sodium chloride by mass. Two slabs, each measuring 22×22×10.2 cm3, were 
296  taken from each site. During the experiment, testing concrete samples were stored in transparent 
297  plastic containers of the appropriate size. The container was placed over another plastic bottle that 
298  functioned as a storage bottle for the salt solution to drain into during the experiment. To avoid the 
299  sample resting in the solution pool that remained after draining, spacers were placed between the 
300  concrete and the container. To empty the salt liquid, two small holes were made at the bottom. The 
301  sample was immersed in the solution for around 20 minutes until the holes were large enough for it to 
302  no longer be submerged. The process for testing for salt scaling is shown in Fig. 5. Before each 
303  freezing and thawing cycle, the sample was placed on top of the spacers in the container. The 
304  container was filled with sodium chloride until the sample was completely submerged. Every few 
305  minutes, the draining process must be examined for clogged or blocked holes.

309  Following 24 hours in the freezer, the concrete samples were taken out and allowed to thaw for an 
310  additional 24-hour period. Afterward, wiped off any litter from the surface of the sample and tested 
311  the mass. Repeat seven times to collect all scaled material, measured the mass after drying, and 
312  shortened the predetermined ten cycles.  
313  2.2.7 Microstructure analysis 
314  Materials cored from sites SR431 and SR28 had low and high-magnification fracture surfaces that 
315  were categorized as limited, moderate, and severe, respectively. These fracture surfaces were 
316  discovered using SEM and CT. Typically, 20 kV of accelerating voltage was used for SEM. 10 m 
317  is the resolution of the CT analysis. 
318  2.2.8 Notes on maintenance activities 
319  The concrete parts had not received any maintenance procedures like vacuuming, sweeping, or 
320  brooming during the NCE's beginning infiltration test results. There was no grip sand on the 
321  roadways because the winter season was not yet started. 
322  Both sites' asphalt roadway surfaces received traction sand application over the winter. The amount 
323  and timing of traction sand treatment were governed by the length and strength of the winter storm. 
324  The application rates and timing of traction sand cannot be estimated. Both sites applied salt and 
325  deicing agents to the asphalt roadway surfaces. NDOT maintenance staff conducted tasks such as 
326  street sweeping and vacuuming within the project's scope. The slabs were exposed to higher weights 
327  and breaking from snowblowers and tire-chained snow removal machines. 
328  3  Results and discussions 
329  The conclusions of two infiltration field tests are shown in Table 3. The average infiltration rate of 
330  newly mixed concrete samples is 0.76-1.02 cm/sec; the final infiltration rate, however, dropped to 
331  0.25-0.025 cm/sec after a year of operation.

342  Figure 8 shows that, following the strength test findings, the SR28 samples lost less mass than the 
343  SR431 samples (only 48 versus 59%) throughout the impact and abrasion test performed. This 
344  equates to a higher than 20% increase in abrasion resistance between sites SR28 and SR431. All

Fig. 9. Density results of the SR28 and SR431 samples

357  average percentage of air voids in samples from site SR28 was 34.5 ± 3.1%, whereas the average 
358  percentage in samples from site SR431 was 36.2 ± 7.1%.

SR28 SR431
 
Fig. 10. Void content results of samples 
359  The samples' great departures from the typical air voids and density indicate that there were issues 
360  with the compaction and placement of the pervious concrete construction at site SR431. The porosity 
361  of both sites exceeds what is necessary by the mixture. This is in line with both areas having smaller 
362  compressive strengths than anticipated. The greater porosity and smaller density of SR431 than SR28 
363  explain the lower compressive strength performance. 
364  3.5  Water Permeability 
365  The SR28 samples displayed greater densities and lower air voids, although the fact that there was no 
366  notable variation in the results of density and air voids between these two sites. The hydraulic 
367  conductivity of SR431 is thus larger than SR28, with respective values of 0.44 ± 0.06 in/sec and 0.53 
368  ± 0.03 in/sec in Fig.11. This adheres to the proportionate connection between permeability and 
369  porosity.

371  3.6  Water Absorption 
372  As demonstrated in Fig. 12, the difference between the SR28 and SR431 was greater than in density 
373  and air spaces. The average percentage of air voids in concrete samples from site SR28 was 34.5  ± 
374  3.1%, whereas the average percentage in samples from site SR431 was 36.2 ± 7.1%.   
375  The air void and the density are controlled mainly by the macro pores (with sizes ranging from 
376  centimeters to millimeters), and the water absorption value is primarily controlled by the micropores 
377  (with sizes ranging from micrometers to nanometers). It may be deduced from analyzing the findings 
378  of the absorption tests to those of the strength tests, which showed different rates of 20% and 50% 
379  among the SR28 and SR431, furthermore, the microstructure is the main factor affecting the 
380  mechanical properties, which will cause the reduction of mechanical properties, although the 
381  macrostructure is not changed. This is also supported by the fact that variation rates for air and 
382  density are less than 5%, but exceed 20% for water permeability and absorption.

383  3.7  Salt scaling 
384  The exterior dimensions of concrete samples subjected to seven freeze/thaw cycles using a 3% NaCl 
385  solution are shown in Figure 13. The SR431 samples display more noticeable salt scaling compared 
386  to the SR28 which have exterior dimensions that are generally well-retained. Figure 14 shows the 
387  mass loss from SR28 and SR431 has a math relationship with freeze/thaw cycles in a solution of 3% 
388  salt solution. The picture shows that the SR28 site's mass loss is more stable than the SR431.  The 
389  mass losses changing the SR28 were from 81.07% and 27.24% after seven freeze/thaw cycles in 3% 
390  NaCl solution, whereas the mass losses of the SR431 sample were 90.35% and 89.77%, respectively.

392  3.8  Microstructure investigation 
393  The performance of concrete is greatly influenced, as was already shown, by the microstructures of 
394  the samples. The microstructure must next be investigated to understand the causes behind 
395  performance degradation. In this section, the porosity and 3D images of the SR28 and SR431 core 
396  samples were examined using SEM and μCT. The SEM was utilized to highlight the structure of two 
397  aggregates in interfaces, while the μCT was used to exhibit porous with a resolution of 10 μm and a 
398  3D photograph. 
399  3.8.1 SEM 
400  The samples suffered from three levels of dicing salt, limited, moderate, and severe (termed as 
401  SR431-lim, SR431-mod, and SR431-sev, SR28-lim, SR28-mod, and SR28-sev, respectively) were 
402  observed by using SEM. Figure 15 shows the SEM characteristics of the core from the SR431 site. 
403  Parts a), b), and c) of this figure stand for limited, moderate, and severe conditions, respectively. 
404  Although there are a few porous areas, part a) of the small sample exhibits a rather strong amorphous 
405  cementitious phase. The amount of amorphous phase has greatly decreased in section b), where 
406  needle-shaped precipitates may be seen. Additionally, as can be shown in section c), the amorphous 
407  phase evolved into pores, and many tiny crystals have been observed in the pores. 
408  The SEM of SR431 is shown in Fig. 16 to show more structural properties. The limited, moderate, 
409  and severe environments were shown in parts a), b), and c), correspondingly. A fraction of 
410  the cementitious phase contained several crystal structures, while other similar amorphous phases 
411  were also found but lacked random orientations. Despite the majority of the material in part b being 
412  the homogeneous amorphous binder phase, a great number of needle-shaped deposits be detected. 
413  The majority of the phase has been replaced as the dominant phase in part c) by the needle-shaped 
414  precipitates, which have grown into massive crystals.

415  In Fig. 17, the high-magnification SEM pictures of SR431 under different conditions. Part a) gives 
416  the needle-shaped precipitates with diameters around 100 nm and smooth or rough surfaces. In the 
417  needle-shaped agglomerates, a minor quantity of the binder phases, which primarily contribute to the 
418  samples' strength, may still be visible. However, as illustrated in section b), the binder phase is rarely 
419  visible, and many crystals were found in place of sediments in the shape of needles. The diameter is 
420  1m and the length is 10 m of the crystals that were measured. This explains why these samples 
421  have the worst strength.

423  The microstructure of the SR28 sample also was studied the same as the SR431. Figure 18 shows the 
424  SEM pictures of the fracture surfaces of samples of SR28. The fracture surface of the limited 
425  selection one, illustrated in part a), has a normal amorphous phase. It can be seen that the 
426  microscopic morphology of the sample is very dense, and the pores are invisible. No residues are 
427  seen on the fracture surface, which is relatively flat. In moderate samples, the surface is less flat than 
428  in limited samples. Despite the main binder phase still predominating, some uniformly distributed 
429  precipitates have been found. The severe samples exhibit extremely rough surfaces with many crystal 
430  residues, similar to the samples from site SR431 (part c). 
431  Figure 19 depicts the SEM fracture morphology of a cored sample of SR28. The amorphous 
432  binder phase is in great condition and there aren't many precipitates in part a). Part b shows that the 
22

433  homogenous amorphous phase has decreased in quantity and has been replaced by some crystal-sized 
434  nanoparticles. Distinct from the SR431, the precipitated equidistant crystals are the dominant phase 
435  in SR28, and the majority of the amorphous phase is present. Approximately 1 m is the average size 
436  of the isotropic crystals. The samples from SR431-lim share a microstructure with SR28-mod 
437  samples that features nano-sized precipitates incorporated in the structure. 
438  The morphology of SR28-mod samples under different conditions showed in Fig. 20 using magnified 
439  high-magnification SEM. The amorphous binder phase contains a few isotropic crystals.  
440  Furthermore, in b), a little amount of amorphous phase and a lot of isotropic crystals were discovered 
441  to be the dominating phases. The crystals were around 1 m in size on average.  
442  It is commonly known that the primary binder material responsible for the concrete's strength is the 
443  C-S-H phase structure. The C-S-H composition in these samples of pervious concrete determines the 
444  variations in overall performances. The figures above show that as the environment changed, the 
445  microstructure transformed from a high-density C-S-H phase to high porosity, which greatly 
446  decreased the cement strength and increased porosity, permeability, and water absorption. And the 
447  compressive strength and wear resistance were also reduced.

449  3.8.2 3D X-ray tomography (μCT) 
450  The μCT data prove that the microstructure of materials cored from SR28 and SR431 locations has 
451  changed. Since the μCT has a resolution of 10 m as opposed to the tests for water permeability and 
452  the number of air voids, it may detect multiscale pores in the porosities, which is the most crucial 
453  component in establishing the final characteristics. 
454  The samples from SR28 and SR431 exhibit the usual 2D microstructures in Figs. 21 and 22. As 
455  demonstrated by these pictures, pore content was higher in SR431 than in SR28. 
456  Table 4 shows the assessed porosity results of the μCT test. As shown in the table, with values of 
457  31.4% and 47.2%, Samples from sites SR28 and SR431 have different levels of porosity.  Comparing 
458  the μCT test results to the air voids content data indicates similar findings, that the SR431 samples 
459  are more porous than the SR28 samples.

461  Major changes in microstructure might result from several different reasons. First, the cement binder 
462  phase morphologies were significantly chemically altered by maintenance operations like deicer 
463  impact. The degree of the chemical reaction between the deicers and cement is directly proportional 
464  to the exposure of the deicing agent. Second, the wintertime freeze/thaw damage will cause serious 
465  physical damage to the cement binder phase. SEM scans and CT findings can also identify this. 
466  Thirdly, the binder phase structure will be impacted by the execution process. The ratio of water to 
467  cement has a significant impact on the final qualities of the concrete. Due to the relative porosity of 
468  pervious concrete, it isn't straightforward to maintain a constant water/cement ratio in all locations. 
469  Consequently, the water-to-cement ratio in samples from various places may vary significantly. The 
470  surface quality of the aggregates is yet another crucial element that affects how pervious concrete 
471  pavements ultimately perform. 
472  Although the mechanical properties reduction trend of the concrete materials with exposure to 
473  various deicers shows different results, in general, the negative impact of deicers on the mechanical 
474  properties of concrete still can be reflected from a statistical perspective (Shi, 2009; Sajid, 2022). It 
475  was claimed that the chemical reaction between the deicer along with the freeze/thaw damage, which 
476  resulted from the microstructure change of the concrete, are the major reasons for the reduction of the 
477  mechanical properties of the concrete samples cored from these sites. Microstructure analysis results 
478  have confirmed the chemical reaction between deicers and the Ca-rich cementitious phases in 
479  concrete (Farnam, 2015; Qiao, 2021). It was found that the intact layered structure C-S-H phases can 
480  be observed in the samples without exposure to deicers, and the surfaces of the pores are smoother 
481  than those with exposure to deicers (Xie, 2015). The silica in C-S-H is organized in single chains 
482  whereas that in M-S-H is in the form of silica sheets (Farnam, 2015). In addition to a different molar 
28

483  ratio of Si/Ca, M-S-H contains more chemically bound water than C-S-H (Lothenbach, 2015). The 
484  introduction of MgCl  is prone to reduce the pH value of the pore solution, thus facilitating the 
2
485  formation of M-S-H due to the reaction between Mg(OH)  and the silica (Helmy, 1991). 
2
486  Our latest study has elucidated the fatal impact of MgCl  on concrete materials (Xie, 2019). As 
2
487  demonstrated in Eq. (1), the reaction between the MgCl  and the cementitious calcium silicate 
2
488  hydrate (C-S-H) leads to a non-cementitious magnesium silicate hydrate (M-S-H). In addition, as 
489  shown in Eq. (2), MgCl  can also react with Ca(OH) to form a crystalline Mg(OH) . The formation 
2 2  2
490  of CaCl  in confined concrete pores results in the enhancement of the crystallization pressure and 
2
491  expansive forces, which leads to the internal cracks of concrete. 
492  MgCl  + C-S-H → M-S-H + CaCl …………………………….(1) 
2 2
493  MgCl  + Ca(OH)  → Mg(OH)  + CaCl …………………….…(2) 
2 2 2 2
494  Laboratory studies reported the formation of detrimental calcium oxychloride (3CaO•CaCl •15H O) 
2 2
495  phase as a result of exposure to MgCl (Sutter, 2006). The proposed mechanism is based on 
2 
496  Equations (2) and (3): 
497  3Ca(OH)  + CaCl  + 12H O → 3CaO•CaCl •15H O………………(3) 
2 2 2 2 2
498  Apart from the plate-like calcium oxychloride crystals and their carbonate phase in voids and cracks, 
499  Friedel’s salt (3CaO·Al O ·CaCl ·10H O) is another important precipitate with exposure to chloride 
2 3 2 2
500  salts. It was also claimed that the chemical reactions between MgCl2 and C-S-H are more 
501  complicated than the known reactions (1) to (3). One additional chemical reaction that might have 
502  occurred is: 
503  a MgCl  + b C-S-H + H O → c M-S-H + d CaMg Cl ∙(H O) …………….(4) 
2 2 2 6 2 12
504  Previous studies have demonstrated that for those exposed to NaCl solution, needle-shaped 
505  precipitates, which are nanometers in diameter, can be observed in the C-S-H phase (Xie, 2019). This 
506  morphology is well agreed with the SR 431 samples in this study. However, the concrete samples 
507  exposed to MgCl  solutions featured a highly porous microstructure with nano-sized crystalline Mg-
2
508  riched precipitates, well agreed with the SR 28 samples in this study. Although the microstructure 
509  analysis has shed light on the potential reasons for the field samples, it is necessary to further explore 
510  the deep deterioration mechanism of the environmental impact on the durability of pervious concrete 
511  pavement with a synergistic attack from freeze/thaw, de-icers, loading, clogging, and complicated 
512  maintenance activities.  
513  4  Conclusions 
514  ⚫  Following engineering property testing, it was determined that samples cored from SR28 exhibit 
515  higher compressive and splitting tensile strength than the SR431. Those cored from SR28 have 
516  an abrasion resistance that is around 20% greater than the SR431. 
517  ⚫  The SR28 samples have a slightly greater density, a reduced air void content (approximately 
518  5%) than the SR431, and a lower hydraulic conductivity than the SR431. 
29 
 

519  ⚫  The water absorption of SR28 samples was approximately 50% less than those extracted from 
520  SR431. In addition, SR28 has higher freeze/thaw resilience. 
521  ⚫  According to the results of SEM pictures of the SR28 and SR431 samples, the limited group 
522  exhibits good performance in the binder, however, samples under moderate conditions exhibit 
523  some precipitates with a needle-like shape embedded in phase. The major phase of the severe 
524  concrete samples showed many precipitated micro-sized crystals. The CT results display that 
525  the SR28 samples had much less porosity than SR431 at the micrometer scale.
