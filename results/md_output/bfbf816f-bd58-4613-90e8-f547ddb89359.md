In order to test this method, the energy consumption of a total 
of 12 hours, namely from 12:00 until 23:00 of 16/3/2016, have 
been forecasted. These hours are chosen because they refer to 
the hours of greatest activity in the building (higher variation in

forecast the electricity consumption of an office building in the 
following hours. This method uses the value of the electricity 
consumption from last hours to preview this value for the next 
hour.   
By comparing the results of the GFS.FR.MOGUL method to 
the results of some other previous works it is concluded that this 
method can present a better electricity consumption profile for 
the  following  hours.  The  presented  results  in  this  paper  in 
comparison  to  the  results  of  some  other  fuzzy  rule  based 
methods, namely HyFIS and WM, are more reliable and all 
calculated errors ate closer to the average error. In other methods, 
there is usually a large deference between some calculated errors 
and the average error of the method. These results show that the 
GFS.FR.MOGUL method is more trustable that the other fuzzy 
rule base methods. In addition, these results have been compared 
to the results of some different ANN approaches. The average 
error  of  the  GFS.FR.MOGUL  method  in  comparison  to  the
