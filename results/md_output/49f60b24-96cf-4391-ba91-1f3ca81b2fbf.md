1.2 SOP Summary 
 
Title  
 
 
Carbohydrate Assay 1: Sugars (Glucose, Sucrose, Fructose) 
 
 
Brief description  
 
 
Sugars are formed by the plant during photosynthesis. They can act as signalling molecules 
and regulators of  gene expression and thus  regulate  plant growth (Eveland  et al., 2012). 
Soluble sugars are highly sensitive to environmental factor variations such as light, water and 
temperature which may lead to a significant reduction in the supply of soluble sugars to sink 
tissues due to a decreased efficiency of photosynthesis in source tissues. Sucrose and glucose 
either act as substrates for cellular respiration or as osmolytes to maintain cell homeostasis 
while fructose is related to secondary metabolites synthesis (Rosa et al., 2009).

2 Protocol Steps  
 
1st stage: Extraction 
 
Leaves 
•  Keep the samples on ice 
•  Add 200 μL of ethanol 80% to 50 mg frozen powdered material 
•  Incubate for 20 min at 78 oC and 550 rpm shaking 
•  Centrifuge for 5 min at 14,000 rpm, 4 oC 
•  Transfer the supernatant in an eppendorf (keep on ice)  
•  Add 100 μL of ethanol 50% to the pellet 
•  Incubate for 20 min at 78 oC and 550 rpm shaking 
•  Centrifuge for 5min at 14,000rpm, 4 oC 
•  Transfer the supernatant in an eppendorf (keep on ice) 
 
Roots 
•  Keep the samples on ice 
•  Add 400 μL of ethanol 80% to 50 mg frozen powdered material 
•  Incubate for 20 min at 78 oC and 550 rpm shaking 
•  Centrifuge for 5min at 14,000 rpm, 4 oC 
•  Transfer the supernatant in an eppendorf (keep on ice)  
•  Add 100 μL of ethanol 50% to the pellet 
•  Incubate for 20 min at 78 oC and 550 rpm shaking 
•  Centrifuge for 5min at 14,000 rpm, 4 oC 
•  Transfer the supernatant in an eppendorf (keep on ice)  
•  Add 100 μL of ethanol 50% to the pellet 
•  Incubate for 20 min at 78 oC and 550 rpm shaking 
•  Centrifuge for 5min at 14,000 rpm, 4 oC 
•  Transfer the supernatant in an eppendorf (keep on ice) 
 
After the extraction, prepare a Master-Mix plate with 200 μL in each well (cell)→ Store at -80 oC 
 
2nd stage: Glucose-Fructose-Sucrose Measurement 
 
•  Freshly prepare a master mix (for 100 samples) 
a.  20 mL (50 mM HEPES, pH = 7 + 5 mM MgCl  (store at 4 oC) 
2
b.  12 mg NADP 
c.  20 mg ATP (- 80 oC) 
d.  20 μL G6PDH (from yeast 127671) 
•  Dispense 200 μL of the master mix in a separate well for each sample to be measured 
•  Add sample (10 μL for leaves and 10 μL for roots)  
•  Mix plate on thermomixer (max 1,000 rpm) 
•  Use 3-4 wells for blank (only the Master Mix inside and the enzyme after the baseline) 
•  Place plate in a microplate reader (Anthos HtII) and read NADPH absorbance at 340 nm 
(against 405 nm as blank) until you get a baseline

Carbohydrate Assay 1: Sugars (Glucose, 
 
Sucrose, Fructose) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Dissolve the enzyme and keep it on ice 
a.  Hexokinase  
i.  (From yeast, 1426362), centrifuge 50 μL and resuspend pellet in 300 μL HEPPES 
buffer 
ii.  Add 2 μL of hexokinase to the master mix plate to determine glucose  
iii.  Let reaction stabilise (about 20 min). 
 
b.  PGI (Phosphoglucoisomerase)  
i.  (From yeast, 128139), centrifuge 50 μL and resuspend pellet in 300 μL HEPPES 
buffer 
ii.  Add 2 μL of PGI (phosphoglucoisomerase) to the master mix plate to determine 
Fructose  
iii.  Let reaction stabilise (about 10 min) 
 
c.  Invertase 
i.  Dissolve 50 mg in 500 μL HEPES buffer 
ii.  Add 4 μL of Invertase to the master mix plate   to determine Sucrose  
iii.  Let reaction stabilise (about 30 min) 
 
Calculations 
 
Sugars = (HL - BL) * ((E+L)/S) * (1/L) * DF * 1000 
 
with   Sugars = Glucose or Fructose or Sucrose (μmol mg−1 FW) 
          BS = Baseline 
          HL = Absorbance of each sugar 
          S = μL of supernatant 
          DF = Dilution Factor  
          L = mg of Leaves  
          E = μL of leaf extraction  
 
To calculate the dilution factor (DF) 
For example, if you extract 250 mg of tissue with 750 μL of extraction buffer, the dilution factor is 4 
(250 μL + 750 μL) / 250 μL).
