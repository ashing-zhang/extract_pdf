der” points in any cluster. Measuring density, measuring mountains vs valleys * Estimate density by
weighted count of close points
Other measures: * Within‑cluster average distance * Mean of within‑cluster average distance over
nearest‑cluster average distance (silhouette score) * Within‑cluster similarity measure to normal/u‑
niform * Within‑cluster (squared) distance to centroid (this is the k‑Means loss function) * Correlation
coefficient between distance we originally had to the distance the are induced by the clustering (Hu‑
berts Gamma) * Entropy of cluster sizes * Average largest within‑cluster gap * Variation of clusterings
