PROFILE Statistical Analysis Plan 
4  Introduction 
4.1  Preface 
The hypothesis is that biomarker-driven stratification will facilitate personalised therapy in 
Crohn’s disease, and will improve clinical care. It will do this through identification of a group 
of participants destined to develop a more severe, relapsing course and who will benefit from 
“Top-Down” therapy while protecting those participants destined to experience more indolent 
disease from the risks and side-effects of unnecessary immunosuppression. 
This is a randomised, multi-centre, biomarker-stratified, open-label trial in participants newly 
diagnosed  with  Crohn’s  disease  (enrolled  within  6  months  of  diagnosis).  Participants  are 
randomised to either “Top-Down” or “Accelerated Step-Up” therapy. 
4.2  Purpose of the analyses 
These will be the final analyses that will be performed, based on the full and complete data 
set of the trial. They will assess the efficacy endpoints and safety, and estimate the interaction 
effect between biomarker and treatment. 
 
Of  note,  the  primary  analysis  study-wide  will  be  focusing  on  the  biomarker-treatment 
interaction and not the main effects. However, a key and complementary analysis will be 
examining the relative treatment and safety effects between “Accelerated Step-Up” and “Top-
Down” therapy arms.

5  Trial Objectives and Endpoints 
5.1  Trial Objectives 
(ICH E3; 8.) 
To  demonstrate  that  a  whole-blood  prognostic  biomarker  can  improve  clinical  outcomes, 
quality of life, and health resource allocation by facilitating the delivery of personalised therapy 
from diagnosis in Crohn’s disease.  
5.2  Endpoints 
(ICH E9; 2.2.2) 
5.2.1  Primary Endpoint 
Incidence of sustained surgery and steroid free remission from completion of a protocolised 
(maximum 8-week regimen) steroid induction treatment through to week 48. 
 
Remission at each visit is a composite of two conditions 
•  HBI score <=4 
•  Absence of objective evidence of inflammation:  both 
CRP<=ULN  and  calprotectin<200 g/g. If both values are missing then the condition 
is deemed missing. If just one value is missing then it is assumed to be below the 
threshold. 
If either or both conditions hold then the participant is in remission at the visit.  
This is equivalent to HBI<=4 at all assessments, or if symptoms are present (HBI>=5) there is 
no objective evidence of inflammation (CRP<=ULN and calprotectin<200). Requirement for 
an extended induction or additional course of systemic steroids or surgery for active Crohn's 
disease would result in failure to meet primary outcome measure. 
The outcome of each possible permutation of HBI + CRP + calprotectin results is given below 
 
HBI  CRP  calpro  Outcome 
<5  <=ULN  <=200  remission 
<5  <=ULN  missing  remission 
<5  missing  <=200  remission 
<5  missing  missing  remission 
<5  <=ULN  >200  remission 
<5  >ULN  <=200  remission 
<5  >ULN  >200  remission 
<5  >ULN  missing  remission 
<5  missing  >200  remission 
>=5  <=ULN  <=200  remission 
>=5  <=ULN  missing  remission 
>=5  missing  <=200  remission 
>=5  missing  missing  missing 
>=5  <=ULN  >200  flare 
>=5  >ULN  <=200  flare 
>=5  >ULN  >200  flare 
>=5  >ULN  missing  flare 
>=5  missing  >200  flare

5.2.2  Secondary Endpoints 
 
1. Endoscopic remission at week 48 (defined by absence of ulceration i.e. SES-CD ulcer 
subscore = 0). Centrally-read endoscopic scores will be used where available. Where these 
are not available locally-read scores will be used.  
2. Quality of life averaged across weeks 16, 32 and 48 (using disease specific IBD-Q score).  
3.i Number of flares requiring treatment escalation by week 48 primary follow-up period.* 
Determined from adjudication of CRF data. 
3.ii Cumulative steroid exposure by week 48 primary follow-up period (defined by number of 
courses of steroids for active Crohn’s disease). Determined from adjudication of CRF data. 
3.iii Number of hospital admissions and surgeries related to Crohn’s disease by week 48 
primary follow-up period.  The number of hospital admissions will be derived from the AE 
information; the number of surgeries is directly captured in the CRF. The two counts will simply 
be added together without attempting to identify coincident hospitalisation-surgery events.  
 
*flares will be considered as protocol definition of flare indicating need for treatment escalation 
5.2.3  Tertiary endpoints

week 48.* 
 
*MRI simplified MaRIA and Lemann Index scores will be obtained only from centrally-read 
MRI scans. 
 
5.2.5  Other samples collected during PROFILE 
The following are captured as samples, but will not be processed during the primary trial 
follow-up period nor included in the trial database. Hence they will not be considered within 
the scope of this SAP but may be analysed later.  
•  RNA transcriptomic data. 
•  Serum proteomic data. 
•  Faecal microbiome data. 
•  Faecal metabolomic data. 
•  Histopathological data. 
6  Trial Methods/ 
6.1  General Trial Design and Plan 
(ICH E3;9) 
The trial is a parallel randomised control trial with two arms.  The treatments are two different 
treatment strategies (Accelerated Step-up; Top-down) of corticosteroids, immunomodulators 
and Infliximab, with additional protocolised criteria and regimens for rescue therapy; see the 
protocol for precise descriptions. 
The  randomisation  is  open-label,  however the biomarker  stratification  factor  measured  at 
baseline is kept blinded to participants and clinicians. 
Participants  are  screened  and  if  recruited  are  then  put  on  an  initial  standard  course  of 
treatment. Randomisation occurs approximately 2 weeks later, if eligibility is confirmed, to one 
of two dosing regimens. Observations are subsequently taken at weeks 4, 16, 32, and 48. Ad 
hoc visits may occur if the condition deteriorates and modifications to the dosing, within the 
guidelines given in the protocol, need to be made.  
6.2  Inclusion-Exclusion Criteria and General Trial Population 
(ICH E3;9.3. ICH E9;2.2.1) 
The trial population is adult participants diagnosed with Crohn’s disease within 6 months. See 
the protocol for a precise list of detailed criteria.

6.3  Randomisation and Blinding 
(ICH E3; 9.4.3, 9.4.6. ICH E9; 2.3.1, 2.3.2) 
Following biomarker assessment, participants in each biomarker subgroup were randomly 
assigned (1:1) to either "Top-Down" or "Accelerated Step-Up" therapy, using a computer-
generated algorithm. At the outset of the trial this occurred within 14 days (plus/minus 5 days). 
However, given some delays for sites to get results of screening investigations returned in 
time for a baseline visit, an amendment was made so that this would occur 14 days after 
screening (plus 10 days). Stratified block randomisation was used, stratifying on biomarker 
subgroup,  (IBDhi/IBDlo),  mucosal  inflammation  (mild  /  moderate  /  severe)  and  disease 
location (colon-only/other) with a randomly generated block size.

For much of the time during the COVID pandemic from March 2020 onwards, many clinic visits 
were carried out virtually. For most of the observations this had little impact, the exceptions 
being the colonoscopy, which could not take place, and two components of the HBI score, that

would normally require a trained clinician to perform an assessment but was instead done by 
the  participant  themselves  under  virtual  guidance.    The  final  week  48  visit  window  for 
colonoscopy and MRE was extended up to three months following the end of trial visit. This 
timeline was selected based on expert clinical opinion, agreed with by the TSC, that results 
within this window would still be valid and accurate. 
Variables collected outside of the time windows will not be used in efficacy analyses, but safety 
events will be included.  
HBI  values  are  a  composite  of  several  individual  questions,  with  ordered  categorical 
responses  that  are  mapped  to  integers  (0,1,2,..)  and  then  added  together.  One  of  the 
components is a physical examination, which is normally undertaken by a trained clinician to 
assess for any abdominal masses. However, during the pandemic from March 2020, this in-
person physical examination was not possible in many instances and a proxy assessment was 
made over the telephone by the participant guided by the local investigators. Collection of this 
data as reported by participants, was considered appropriate given the growing literature 
demonstrating reliability of participant-reported information and notable in this instance high 
association between HBI abdominal mass sub-score reported by participants compared to 
physician-assessed HBI abdominal sub-score (Echarri et al. Telemed J E Health, 2020).  
A scaled version of the HBI will be considered that removes this abdominal mass component, 
as a complimentary endpoint for summary statistics and figures. The full HBI score, using 
either the clinician’s or participant’s assessment, will be used in the primary analysis, but 
sensitivity analyses will treat these as missing, and potentially impute the missing component. 
The primary endpoint is an aggregate over all visits, that assesses if HBI <5 and/or absence 
of objective evidence of inflammation, and if surgery occurred or an additional or extended 
induction course of steroids have been taken; so the value of this binary endpoint can still be 
determined, even if the HBI at one or more visits has the component missing.

7  Sample Size  
(ICH E3; 9.7.2. ICH E9; 3.5) 
Remission rates were estimated using data pertaining to the clinical phenotype of IBDhi and 
IBDlo  participants  and  data  from  the  literature  regarding  response  to  early  anti-TNFα 
(including the original “Step Up-Top Down” trial, D’Haens et al. Lancet, 2008; the SONIC trial, 
Colombel et al. NEJM, 2010; and subgroup analyses of large anti-TNFα trials, D’Haens. Nat 
Rev Gastro Hepatol 2010). 
Estimated remission rates were: IBDhi: “Accelerated Step-Up” 0.3, “Top-Down” 0.7; IBDlo: 
“Accelerated Step-Up” 0.8, “Top-Down” 0.9. The prevalence of IBDhi/ IBDlo is 0.5/0.5 based 
on all of the cohorts in whom the classifier has been assessed. The primary comparison is 
powered as an interaction analysis, where the interaction refers to the difference between the 
relative benefits of "Top-Down" over "Accelerated Step-Up" in each subgroup. Based on the 
remission rates and subgroup prevalence rates above, an interaction of 0.3 can be detected 
with a power of 92% at a 2-sided 5% significance level with a total sample size of 333. 
To allow for a ~17% drop out rate, from the outset of the trial the goal was to recruit 400 
participants across approximately 50 sites around the United Kingdom.

8  General Considerations 
8.1  Timing of Analyses 
The trial closed to new participant screening in December 2021, with the final randomisations 
for the trial in January 2022.  The recruitment rate had initially slowed substantially during the 
COVID  pandemic  but  subsequently  increased,  so  that  the  trial  almost  recruited  to  target 
(n=390 participants randomised). In addition, the dropout rate was less than planned for, as 
monitored during ongoing DMC and TSC meetings, hence the final recruitment number of 
n=390 was felt sufficient to maintain adequate power according to the original trial design.

8.2  Analysis Populations 
(ICH E3; 9.7.1, 11.4.2.5. ICH E9; 5.2) 
•  Full population 
o  All participants who were randomised and met eligibility criteria (all inclusion 
and no exclusion criteria) for the PROFILE trial.  
•  Safety population 
o  All  participants  who  were  randomised  and  received  any  trial  treatment 
(including the initial induction course of steroid medication). 
•  Modified  per-protocol  treatment  population  -  All  participants  who  did  not 
substantially  deviate  from  the  protocol  for  treatment  to  be  determined  on  a  per-
participant  basis.  All  participant  cases  will  be  reviewed  by  an  expert  adjudication 
committee (Prof Miles Parkes, Dr James Lee, Prof James Lindsay).  
o  Treatment escalation without meeting criteria for flare. 
▪  Treatment escalation in absence of HBI score >7, AND CRP >ULN OR 
calprotectin >200ug/ml. 
o  Treatment not escalated despite meeting criteria for flare. 
▪  HBI score >7, AND raised CRP >ULN OR calprotectin >200ug/ml. 
o  Treatment escalated but not in accordance with the trial protocol. 
▪  E.g.  immunomodulator  step  skipped  and  started  on  infliximab;  
infliximab  skipped  and  started  on  adalimumab;  infliximab  or 
immunomodulator not prescribed but given additional course of steroid 
medication. This list is not exhaustive.  
•  Modified  per-protocol  treatment,  schedule  and  procedures  population  -  All 
participants who did not substantially deviate from the protocol including all aspects of 
treatment, trial visits and performance of trial procedures, to be determined on a per-
participant  basis.  All  participant  cases  will  be  reviewed  by  an  expert  adjudication 
committee (Prof Miles Parkes, Dr James Lee, Prof James Lindsay).  
o  Observations made outside the visit window, using the amended time window 
from Baseline for all participants. 
•  Pre-COVID population 
o  All participants completing the study prior to March 2020. 
•  Peri-COVID population 
o  All participants randomised or in follow-up after March 2020.

8.3  Covariates and Subgroups 
(ICH E3; 9.7.1, 11.4.2.1. ICH E9; 5.7) 
The analyses will estimate for the main effect of the biomarker and the interaction between 
the biomarker and treatment, adjusting for baseline variables: 
•  Mucosal Inflammation (mild / moderate / severe) 
•  Disease location (ileal / colonic / ileocolonic) as recorded locally at baseline on the 
Medical history form 
•  Disease  behaviour  (inflammatory  /  other)  as  recorded  locally  at  baseline  on  the 
Medical history form 
•  Smoking status (never / former / current) 
•  Age (16-39,40-64,65+) 
•  BMI (0-19.9, 20-24.9,25-29.9, 30+) 
•  CRP (continuous) 
•  Calprotectin (continuous) 
•  Course of glucocorticoids prior to trial enrolment (yes/no) 
•  Time from date of endoscopy to date of screening  
•  HBI score 
 
Subgroup analyses of potential interest. Subgroups with potential biological plausibility for 
differential effects on biomarker-treatment interaction effect were selected for assessment. 
•  Age in years at baseline (<60 vs >60) 
•  Gender (male vs female) 
•  Ethnicity (European origin vs other) 
•  Smoking status at baseline (current smoker vs other) 
•  Obesity (BMI <30 vs >30) 
•  Time from diagnosis to inclusion in days (<30 vs >30) 
•  Disease location (ileal / colonic / ileocolonic) as recorded locally at baseline on the 
medical history form 
•  Stricturing disease at baseline (passable vs non-passable stricture based on SES-CD 
sub-score) 
•  Severe endoscopic severity at baseline using SES-CD score (>6 vs <6 for ileocolonic 
and colonic disease, and >4 vs <4 for ileal disease) 
•  Presence of ulcers at baseline using SES-CD ulcer sub-score (0 vs >1 for ulcer sub-
score in total SES-CD) 
•  Steroid use at baseline (prednisolone vs budesonide) 
•  Previous abdominal surgery at baseline (unrelated to Crohn’s disease) vs no previous 
abdominal surgery 
•  Any other immune-mediated inflammatory disease at baseline (IMID) vs no other IMID  
 
8.3.1  Post-Baseline Subgroups 
The following groupings are only observable post-baseline. As such they cannot be used to 
determine treatment choice,  but may  be  indicative  of  a  mediating  effect  of  the  treatment 
mechanism.  They are included as tertiary endpoints in 5.2.3.  
The primary and secondary endpoints will have summary tables provided using these as 
subgroups, but not formal regression analysis. Any comparison between such post-baseline 
PROFILE SAP version 2.0  Date of Version 12 MAY 2023  Page 18 of 36 
 

PROFILE Statistical Analysis Plan 
subgroups is dependent on there not being any confounding between the subgroup incidence 
and the endpoint, which is untestable and thus such comparisons will be considered with 
caution. 
•  Development of peri-anal fistula by week 48 (development of peri-anal fistula vs no 
development of peri-anal fistula) 
•  Development  of  endoscopic  stricture  by  week  48  (development  of  stricture  vs  no 
development of stricture) 
•  Three levels of therapy: no anti-TNF therapy; monotherapy; combination therapy. 
•  Thiopurine  at  last  observation  within  each  participant:  no  thiopurine;  optimised 
metabolite levels (6-TGN >235);  non-optimised levels (6-TGN <235)

The following data may be available at the time of final analysis, and if so, will be used to 
define subgroups. 
•  Optimised infliximab trough drug levels (>5ug/g) vs non-optimised infliximab trough 
drug levels (<5ug/g). This will be treated as a post-baseline subgroup. 
•  HLA-DQA1*05 variants vs no HLA-DQA1*05 variants 
 
8.3.3  Coding Details 
The majority of variables to be used as predictor variables in the regression models are binary. 
The parameterisation used to represent the effect of a binary variable will be of the form +/2, 
and -/2 for each of the two possible values. Thus  directly estimates the difference in the 
expected values between the two values {+/2 – (-/2)}=  . This is achieved in the coding by 
setting the contrast to be (+1/2, -1/2). Furthermore when interactions with a second variable 
are included, this interpretation of the main effect is preserved, as the equal-weighted average 
of the predicted effect of the first variable within each of the levels of the second variable. To 
verify this, one can form the design matrix for each possible combination of predictor variables, 
from which the predicted value is obtained by calculating the matrix product with the vector of 
coefficients; inverting the design matrix gives the interpretation of the coefficients—differences 
of  weighted  averages  of  the  group-level  expected  values—which  is  given  below  for  the

8.4  Missing Data 
(ICH E3; 9.7.1, 11.4.2.2. ICH E9;5.3. EMA Guideline on Missing Data in Confirmatory Clinical 
Trials) 
Generally, total population size will be reported in summary tables (and will highlight any 
missing values). Summary statistics will use complete case analysis, which assumes Missing 
Completely At Random. Regression analysis that adjust for covariates, or account for within-
participant correlation in repeat-measures analysis, will be performed which assumes Missing 
At Random.  
See section 5.2.1 for a specific discussion and sensitivity analyses to consider the partially 
missing component of the HBI score.  
If the proportion of missing values falls below 5% for an endpoint then no further sensitivity 
analyses will be performed as the scope to influence the conclusion is too small.  
To deal with any missing baseline covariates Multivariate Imputations using Chain Equations 
(Buuren & Groothuis-Oudshoorn 2011) is used to provide 5 imputed complete data sets. This 
is repeated separately for each endpoint/analysis as the endpoint is used as predictor of the 
missing baseline values; for any longitudinal analysis of repeated observations, the per-patient 
average of the repeated observations is used, along with an average of the visit numbers with 
observations. Rubin’s rules are used to combine the analysis from the multiple imputed data 
sets.  
Where bootstrapping is used to provide confidence intervals around standardised effects on 
the additive scale, then bootstrapping is performed as an outer loop around repeated multiple 
imputations (Schomaker & Heumann 2018) 
 
8.5  Multiple Testing 
(ICH E3; 9.7.1, 11.4.2.5. ICH E9; 2.2.5) 
To formally control for multiple testing, we will perform a closed testing procedure over the 
primary and five secondary endpoints (see section 10.1 and 10.2) testing the biomarker-
treatment  interaction  and  restricting  the  family-wise  type  1  error  rate  to  an  overall  5% 
significance level.  
The methodology to combine together gate-keeping and Holm-Bonferroni methods in formal 
hypothesis testing will be used (Bretz et al. Stat Med 2009), with the diagram below defining 
how the significance levels will be transitioned assuming an initial configuration of 5% at the 
primary endpoint (relapse-free remission) and 0% on all other tests.

9  Summary of Trial Data 
   
All continuous variables will be summarised using the following descriptive statistics: n (non-
missing  sample  size),  mean,  standard  deviation,  median,  maximum  and  minimum.  The 
frequency and percentages (based on the non-missing sample size) of observed levels will be 
reported for all categorical measures. In general, all data will be listed, sorted by treatment, 
biomarker  and  participant,  and  when  appropriate  by  visit  number  within  participant.  All 
summary tables will be structured with a column for each treatment-biomarker combination, 
and marginally for each treatment. The tables will be annotated with the total population size 
relevant to that table/treatment, including any missing observations. 
9.1  Participant Disposition 
The  Visit  Completion  form  and  Withdrawal  form  will  be  used  to  determine  how  far  each 
participant reached within the trial, and provide reasons for withdrawal from data collection, 
and from treatment. 
A figure of cumulative recruitment over time will be provided. 
•  Full population 
o  All participants who were randomised and meet eligibility criteria (all inclusion 
and no exclusion criteria) for the PROFILE trial.  
•  Safety population 
o  All participants who received any trial treatment  
•  Per-protocol population 
o  All participants who did not substantially deviate from the protocol as to be 
determined on a per-participant basis. For cases where it is not clear, those 
participant cases will be referred for review by the central trial team to an expert 
adjudication committee (Prof Miles Parkes, Dr James Lee, Prof James Lindsay).  
Pandemic sensitivity analyses will compare pre-1 March 2020 with 1 March 2020 and beyond. 
This month was selected as this was the date of the first COVID-19 wave building in the UK, 
resulting in a national period of lockdown. Thereafter, for the duration of recruitment and 
follow-up, subsequent waves of incident COVID-19 followed in the UK. 
A skeleton CONSORT diagram should be provided in this section that provides an explicit 
statement of what statistics are to be provided. http://www.consort-statement.org/.

9.2   Derived variables 
•  Primary endpoint, see section 6.4 and 5.2.1 for detailed description of how the endpoint 
is derived. 
•  Several endpoints are the cumulative incidence or total over all visits 
o  Number of Flares 
o  Cumulative Steroid Use 
o  Hospitalisation 
o  Surgery 
 
9.3  Protocol Deviations 
Modifications to participants’ dosing or medication had a set of guidelines described in the 
protocol, termed as “escalation”. Deviations did occur in both directions of escalating or not 
escalating, in breach of the protocol guidelines. But this is a very broad description, and the 
large variety of medications and doses used make it impractical to give a definition based on 
trial data to identify non-compliance.  A 3-member committee will be assembled (Prof Miles 
Parkes, Dr James Lee, Prof James Lindsay) to take expert judgement based on the totality of 
a participant’s notes as to whether, and at which visit, they were non-compliant, and thus 
would leave the visit-specific Per Protocol treatment population and a more stringent Per 
Protocol treatment, schedules and procedures population.

The COVID pandemic meant that face to face clinic visits had to be paused across many sites, 
and so the data collection process and visit windows were modified. See section 6.4 for a full 
description. 
9.4  Demographic and Baseline Variables 
Each participant undergoes a screening visit at which data is observed, and if eligible and 
consenting they commence an initial treatment, common to both arms. Hence the data from 
the screening visit is representative of the participants underlying state of health and will be 
used to present “Baseline” data.  
The following variables will be summarised as per section 0 
•  Gender 
•  Age, Age group (16-39,40-64, 65+) 
•  Ethnicity 
•  Smoking Status 
•  BMI, BMI group (0-19, 20-24,25-29, 30+) 
•  HBI score 
•  Modified HBI score (removing the abdominal examination component) 
•  IBDQ score 
•  CRP 
•  Albumin 
•  Haemoglobin 
•  Faecal Calprotectin 
•  SES-CD score 
•  Disease Location 
•  Disease Behaviour 
•  Time from diagnosis to consent 
•  Biomarker 
 
9.5  Concurrent Illnesses and Medical Conditions 
A fixed list of specific medical conditions is assessed systematically at baseline visit, which 
will be tabulated as to the count and proportion of participants with each condition as per 
section 0. 
PROFILE SAP version 2.0  Date of Version 12 MAY 2023  Page 25 of 36 
 

PROFILE Statistical Analysis Plan 
9.6  Prior and Concurrent Medications 
A fixed list of prior steroid medications is assessed systematically at screening, which will be 
tabulated as to the count and proportion of participants for each medication as per section 0. 
Concurrent medications are captured during the trial and will be surmised with line listings.  
9.7  Treatment Compliance 
Treatment compliance is assessed as a binary variable at each visit, and participants being 
included or excluded from the per-protocol population is where this information is captured. 
See section 9.3 
Any individual participants and specific visits, where not clear if treatment compliance has 
occurred, will be discussed and reviewed by the adjudication committee (Prof Miles Parkes, 
Dr James Lee, Prof James Lindsay). Majority consensus from this committee will be used to 
determine whether treatment compliance has occurred in accordance with the protocol or not.

10  Efficacy Analyses 
The main focus will be on estimating the interaction between treatment and biomarker for each 
of the endpoints, defined as a difference in differences. To compliment this, the treatment 
effect within each biomarker subgroup will also be estimated, along with a marginal effect 
averaging equally across the subgroups. The marginal effect corresponds to the treatment 
effect  when  knowledge  of  the  biomarker  is  not  available  for  individual  participants,  for  a 
population where the distribution of the biomarker is equally split 1:1 between Hi and Lo. 
Each analysis will have 4 comparisons: 
•  Treatment effect for Hi. 
•  Treatment effect for Lo. 
•  Biomarker-Treatment  interaction:  the  difference  between  the  previous  two 
comparisons. 
•  Main treatment effect: average of the Hi- and Lo- treatment effects. 
For endpoints that are analysed on an absolute difference scale these contrasts are simple 
linear transformations of the model parameters. For endpoints/models that use odds ratios, 
relative risks or any non-linear function of the parameter values, the model parameters will be 
used to obtain predicted values on the scale of the endpoint. To calculate the main treatment 
effect,  averages  across  biomarkers  will  be  calculated,  and  the  contrasts  then  potentially 
transformed  back  onto  the  non-linear  scale  of  choice,  using  the  standardisation,  a.k.a. 
parametric g-formula, method (Hernán & Robins, Chapter 13). If adjustment for covariates 
leads  to  non-convergence  on  the  absolute  difference  scale  for  binary  variables,  then  an 
alternative will be to use a logistic scale, and the same standardisation approach taken to 
obtain predicted values on the endpoint scale, averages taken for combinations of treatment, 
biomarker and subgroup, and contrasts taken on the absolute difference scale as desired. 
Inference to provide SE, 95% CIs, and p-values will be done analytically for the linear scale, 
or using non-parametric bootstrapping for the non-linear scale.  
The primary endpoint, and mucosal healing (using SES-CD score) are both binary variables, 
and will be analysed using a generalised linear model with an additive link function to estimate 
absolute differences in incidence. Number of Flares, number of Steroid Courses, and count of 
Hospitalisation or Surgery will be analysed using a linear model. Quality of life is observed 
over repeated visits and will be analysed using a mixed effect repeat measure analysis with a 
clustered participant-level residual error with unstructured covariance over visits, fixed effects 
for visit, and all other covariates assumed to have a constant fixed effect over time.  
The randomisation stratum will be adjusted for as baseline covariates: biomarker subgroup, 
(IBDhi/IBDlo), mucosal inflammation (mild / moderate / severe) and disease location (colon-
only/other) plus the main effect of the covariates listed in section 8.3.  Treatment and the 
interaction between biomarker and treatment will also be included in the models. Quality of 
life and Mucosal Healing (endoscopic remission) will also adjust for the values observed at 
screening.  
The  Full  Analysis  population  will  be  used  for  all  presentations  of  efficacy  variables, 
complimented by using the Per Protocol population in some select cases. The p-values from 
the full analysis population will be used in the process described in section 8.5 to control for 
multiple testing, using just the treatment-biomarker parameter.

The Safety Population will be used to summarise the safety endpoints.  
Pandemic sensitivity analyses will compare pre-1 March 2020 with 1 March 2020 and beyond. 
This month was selected as this was the date of the first COVID-19 wave building in the UK, 
resulting in a national period of lockdown. Thereafter, for the duration of recruitment and 
follow-up, subsequent waves of incident COVID-19 followed in the UK.  
In formal statistical terms the null hypothesis is that the interaction between treatment and 
biomarker is zero. This is asking if the treatment effect in each of the biomarker subgroups is 
the same.  As such it does depend directly on the choice of scale used to measure the (non-
zero) treatment effect, and the modelling assumptions. Statistical significance will be assessed 
in a two-sided manner using a 5% level. However, the focus is on estimation of the magnitude 
of the interaction and providing a measure of uncertainty around the estimate using 95% 
confidence intervals. All assumptions for regression models will be assessed by viewing plots 
of the residual values 
 
10.1 Primary Efficacy Analysis 
The primary endpoint is defined as:  
Incidence of sustained surgery and steroid free remission from completion of a protocolised 
(maximum 8-week regimen) steroid induction treatment through to week 48. 
 
*remission = HBI<4 and/or absence of objective evidence of inflammation.  
This is equivalent to HBI<4 at all assessments, or if symptoms are present (HBI>5) there is 
no objective evidence of inflammation (CRP<ULN and calprotectin<200). Requirement for an 
additional or extended induction course of systemic steroids or surgery for active Crohn's 
disease would result in failure to meet primary outcome measure. 
 
So if the HBI is 5 or greater at any scheduled or unscheduled visit due to active Crohn’s 
disease as assessed by local PI and corroborated by either a raised CRP>ULN or raised 
calprotectin >200 or both, or surgery occurs, or steroids are prescribed (above the protocolised 
maximum 8 week induction treatment), then the primary endpoint will not have been met.  
The primary analysis will proceed as per section 0 using a generalised linear model, and 
additionally adjusting for the HBI total score observed at screening,  with an additive link 
function, or logistic link if convergence problems arise.  
A sensitivity analysis will be performed using the intersection across all visits of the visit-
specific per-protocol populations. 
An exploratory figure will present the proportion of participants meeting the primary endpoint 
at or before each time point using a Kaplan-Meier estimate with 95% confidence intervals.

This  is  the  SES-CD  score  observed  at  week  48  and  will  focus  on  endoscopic  remission 
(defined as absence of ulceration including aphthous ulcerations (ie ulcer subscore=0).  
The analysis will use a generalised linear model with an additive link function, as per section 
0, and in addition to the standard adjustment covariates, will add the baseline SES-CD score.  
The Week 48 Per Protocol population will be used for a sensitivity analysis.  
10.2.2   Number of Flares 
This endpoint is defined cumulatively across all visits, including ad hoc visits. The analysis will 
use linear regression as per section 0. 
A sensitivity analysis will be performed using the intersection across all visits of the visit-
specific per-protocol populations.  
10.2.3   Quality of Life IBDQ (Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire)  
There are 32 questions, each of which is recorded on a seven-point Likert scale, where 1 is 
the worst score and 7 the best (Guyatt et al. Gastroenterology 1989). The total score is derived 
by adding these numerical values up over the 32 questions for each participant-visit.  
Any missing values to individual questions will be ignored and the score scaled to reflect the 
number of “non-missing” values. 
The endpoint is observed over repeated visits and the values at the scheduled visits (but not 
ad  hoc)  will  be  analysed  using  a  mixed  effect  repeat  measure  analysis  with  a  clustered 
participant-level residual error with unstructured covariance over visits, fixed effects for visit, 
and all other covariates assumed to have a constant fixed effect over time. The standard set 
of covariates will be used for adjustment with the addition of the baseline value for IBDQ. A 
treatment effect estimate assumed to be constant over time  will be used for the formal closed 
multiple testing procedure. But individual visit-specific treatment effects at all scheduled visits 
will also  be presented.  
Observations taken at participant-visits belonging to the visit-specific per-protocol population 
will be used for a sensitivity analysis.  
10.2.4  Cumulative Steroid Exposure 
This endpoint is defined as the total number of courses of steroids taken, including those that 
were increased in line with the protocol, and any non-compliant increases to treat active 
Crohn’s disease. The analysis will use linear regression as per section 0. 
A sensitivity analysis will be performed using the intersection across all visits of the visit-
specific per-protocol populations.  
10.2.5   Number of Hospital Admissions and Surgeries for Crohn’s disease 
The incidence of surgery for Crohn’s disease is captured directly within the CRF. An SAE that 
requires hospitalisation will capture hospital admissions.  Hence the count is taken across all 
visits, including ad hoc visits, and aggregated into a single endpoint per participant.  
The analysis will proceed as per section 0 using a generalised linear model with an additive 
link function.

PROFILE Statistical Analysis Plan 
A sensitivity analysis will be performed using the intersection across all visits of the visit-
specific per-protocol populations.  
10.2.6  HBI 
HBI score will be presented using spaghetti plots, and mean values with CIs at each visit and 
biomarker-treatment presented. A mixed effect repeat measure analysis will be performed with 
a  clustered  participant-level  residual  error  with  unstructured  covariance  over  visits,  fixed 
effects for visit, and all other covariates assumed to have a constant fixed effect over time. 
The standard set of covariates will be used for adjustment with the addition of the baseline 
value. 
The analysis will performed twice on two variations of the endpoint: 
•  a  scaled  version  of  the  score  that  excludes  the  component  based  on  a  physical 
examination 
•  using the participant reported physical examination.  
10.2.7   Incidence of Surgery 
The individual component of the primary endpoint will be considered in isolation. 
The analysis will proceed as per section 0 using a generalised linear model with an additive 
link function.  
10.2.8   Incidence of Steroid Use 
The individual component of the primary endpoint will be considered in isolation. This is not 
the cumulative count of steroids, but rather simply if steroids were used at any point in time 
above the maximum 8 week initial induction treatment. 
The analysis will proceed as per section 0 using a generalised linear model with an additive 
link function.  
 
10.3  COVID sensitivity analyses 
For each of the primary and secondary endpoints, the analyses will be repeated for the pre- 
and peri-covid populations. 
10.3.1  Seemingly Unrelated Regression 
The components of the primary and secondary endpoints, in particular those that relied on 
colonoscopy visits, were not able to be performed during the lockdown restrictions, and thus 
have higher incidence of missing values. Hence a joint model across several key endpoints, 
for the week 48 value, may increase precision to the comparisons by accounting for the 
within-participant correlation and thus make better use of participants with partial 
observations for a subset of the endpoints.  A joint linear model that allows an unstructured 
residual error covariance matrix will be fitted to the following endpoints on their original, 
untransformed, scales. 
•  HBI score 
•  Centrally-read SES-CD 
•  Locally-read SES-CD 
PROFILE SAP version 2.0  Date of Version 12 MAY 2023  Page 30 of 36 
 

PROFILE Statistical Analysis Plan 
•  Number of Flares 
•  IBDQ 
•  Cumulative Steroid exposure 
•  Number of Hospital admissions and surgeries 
•  Faecal Calprotectin – log transformed 
Fixed effects will be stratified by the endpoint, and adjust for treatment-biomarker interaction 
plus the baseline covariates detailed in 8.3. The baseline or screening value of the endpoint 
will be used as an adjustor where a meaningful baseline value exists, or set to a dummy 
value of 0. Values observed at visits before week 48 will not be considered.  
The same set of comparisons as per the primary analysis will be presented with estimates, 
SE, confidence intervals and p-values.  
The R code will use the gls function taken from the nlme package and will be of this nature, 
as an illustration: 
gls(value~variable/(treatment*biomarker + covariate +                                                
baseline_value),correlation = corSymm(form=~var_num|subjid),     
weights=varIdent(form=~1|variable)) 
 
where var_num is the endpoint, variable, mapped to a sequence of consecutive integers, as 
demanded by the software. 
Censored observations for Faecal Calprotectin, where the observation is above the limit of 
detection will be handled using the EM algorithm [Dempster, Laird & Rubin, 1977], and a 
simulation exercise will be performed to establish that the implementation with bespoke code 
provides an unbiased estimate with correct coverage of confidence intervals.  
 
10.4  Subgroup Analyses 
For each of the primary and secondary analysis, the subgroup analyses will be performed 
using the full analysis population.  
Summary tables broken down by treatment-biomarker-subgroup will be produced 
Sequentially, and considering in turn each subgroup from section 8.3, the main effects, 2nd- 
and 3rd-order interactions will be presented, with the estimates and 95% confidence 
intervals, but not the p-values. Interpretation of the estimates’ magnitude is more important 
that consideration of statistical significance, including whether the subgroup could modify the 
optimal choice of treatment. Should a subgroup interaction prompt reporting in academic 
journals, then a stratified version of the model may be reported, as distinct from the 
difference-of-difference-of-difference that a 3-way interaction represents, and would be 
calculated outside the main statistical report.  
10.5 Tertiary and Exploratory Efficacy Analyses 
Summary statistics as described in section 0 will be provided for the tertiary and exploratory 
endpoints as detailed in sections 5.2.3 and 5.2.4, stratified by visit, treatment and biomarker. 
For continuous variables, the change from baseline (or screening value where appropriate)

will be plotted over time, with lines connecting the observations within an individual participant 
(a spaghetti plot), with colour coding used to distinguish between the treatment-biomarkers. 
Box and Whisker plots will also be provided to represent their distribution in a cross-sectional 
manner. Kaplan-Meier plots will be presented for time-to-event endpoints. 
11  Safety Analyses 
11.1  Adverse Events 
Safety Analyses will use the Safety Population and be broken down by biomarker-treatment, 
and treatment (pooling across biomarker).  
The data have MedDRA coding provided for each event reported, along with an assessment 
of causality, seriousness, and expectedness. For each preferred term, there will be a count of 
the number of participants (any repetitions of an AE within the same participant will be ignored), 
proportion of the population, and number of events (to include any repetitions), broken down 
as described above, and also split into serious and non-serious AEs.  The preferred terms will 
be grouped by the System Organ Class.  
For more meaningful reporting, a grouping of the preferred terms will be defined (see appendix) 
and the same format of reporting provided.   
A figure will be provided, a “Dot Plot” that, for each grouping of preferred terms, gives the 
absolute risk for each biomarker-treatment on a line representing the unit interval and also 
give the relative risk estimate and 95% CI on a logarithmic relative risk scale.  
A line listing of each AE, split into serious and non-serious AEs, will be provided sorted by 
treatment-biomarker, SOC, PT, causality and expectedness, in that order of sorting. 
11.2  Pregnancies 
A line list of pregnancies that occurred for participants will be produced.  
12  Reporting Conventions 
P-values ≥0.001 will be reported to 3 decimal places; p-values less than 0.001 will be reported 
as “<0.001”. The mean, standard deviation, and any other statistics other than quantiles, will 
be reported to one decimal place greater than the original data. Quantiles, such as median, or 
minimum and maximum will use the same number of decimal places as the original data. 
Estimated parameters, not on the same scale as raw observations (e.g. regression coefficients) 
will be reported to 3 significant figures.  Percentages will be rounded to whole numbers unless 
they are less than 1%. 
13  Technical Details 
R version 4.1 will be the software tool used, correct at the time of writing. Full documentation 
of all versions and add-on packages will be recorded as the report is generated.

14  Summary of Changes   
14.1 From Protocol  
At the TSC held on 10th September 2018, at which 30 participants had been randomised, the 
biomarker thresholds had been further optimised, and a decision was taken to accept the 
modified thresholds used to define IBDhi and IBDlo using this biomarker blood-test. A few of 
the existing participants’ biomarker value were changed but given this was very early on in the 
trial, subsequent stratified randomisation was able to be maintained and remained blinded to 
the trial management group, the TSC, participants and site principal investigators.  
14.2  From SAP V1  
•  Modification of adjusting covariates to include baseline HBI. 
•  Added details on using multiple imputation in conjunction with bootstrapping, to deal 
with missing values in baseline covariates.  
•  Additional endpoints relating to endoscopy (central & local reading) and only using 
incidence of ulcers, rather than composite with the total SES-CD. 
•  Additional Kaplan-Meier curve to describe time to primary endpoint. 
•  Seemingly Unrelated regression uses faecal calprotectin on a log-transformed scale 
and uses EM algorithm to deal with censored observations above limit of detection. 
•  Clarification of primary outcome measure to include objective markers of active 
inflammation (CRP and calprotectin) in the definition of presence and absence of 
remission (reflecting their inclusion in definition of flare in the protocol). This was 
agreed by the TSC 26/04/2023: 
•  Incidence of sustained surgery and steroid free remission from completion of a 
protocolised (maximum 8-week regimen) steroid induction treatment through to week 
48. 
•  Clarification of secondary endpoint re method to define endoscopic remission 
o  Endoscopic remission at week 48 (defined by absence of ulceration i.e. SES-
CD ulcer subscore = 0). Centrally-read endoscopic scores will be used where 
available. Where these are not available locally-read scores will be used 
•  Modification of secondary endpoint relating to timepoints for assessment of quality of 
life 
o  Quality of life averaged across weeks 16, 32 and 48 (using disease specific 
IBD-Q score).  
•  Addition of the following tertiary end-points for analysis 
o  Incidence of sustained surgery and steroid free remission from completion of a 
standard (maximum 8-week regimen) steroid induction treatment through to 
week 48 (when remission defined using clinical parameters alone, HBI < 5). 
o  Clinical remission (defined as HBI < 5) at weeks 4,16, 32 and 48. 
o  Average clinical disease activity (comparison of mean HBI scores in each group) 
at weeks 4,16,32 and 48.

o  Time to event, time from baseline to first flare or need for surgery for Crohn’s 
disease, which may occur during the protocolised induction course of steroid 
medication. 
o  Time  to  event,  time  from  baseline  to  second  flare  or  need  for  surgery  for 
Crohn’s disease.  
o  Time to event, time from baseline to starting on anti-TNF therapy for Crohn’s 
disease  
o  Patient reported clinical remission (using score generated from abdominal pain 
and stool frequency components of HBI score – abdominal pain <1 and stool 
frequency <3)  at weeks 4,16,32,48.  
o  Development of peri-anal abscess or fistula (development of peri-anal abscess 
/ fistula vs no development of peri-anal abscess / fistula) at weeks 4,16,32,48. 
o  Anti-TNF therapy at last observation: no anti-TNF therapy; monotherapy anti-
TNF; combination therapy anti-TNF. 
o  Thiopurine at last observation within each participant: no thiopurine; optimised 
metabolite levels (6-TGN >235);  non-optimised levels (6-TGN <235).  
 
15  Quality Control 
The derivation of the primary endpoint is complex as it involves multiple visits and multiple 
questions from the CRF. Hence it will be derived by a separate QC statistician and compared, 
and also a random set of 10 participants will be checked by hand.  
The primary analysis will be replicated by a separate QC statistician. Overall, the code and 
data manipulations will be reviewed by a separate statistician.
