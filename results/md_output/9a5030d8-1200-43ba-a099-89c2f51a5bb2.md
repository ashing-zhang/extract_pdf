acquired  and  community  acquired  BSI.    Objective:  The  aim  of  our  study  was  to 
 
determine, is the sensitivity testing if sufficient for treating BSI caused by S. aureus by 
understanding the difference between community associated and healthcare associated S. 
aureus  infection  in  terms  of  methicillin  resistance,  biofilm  producing  ability  and 
antimicrobial resistance pattern. As previous study says hospital acquired BSI is more 
resistant and having more ability to form biofilm on implants which makes them more 
difficult to handle. As there is a lack of next level treatment possibilities we need to find 
out all relative information to fill the gap between testing and treatment. Methods: This is 
a prospective study carried out on Staphylococcus aureus isolated from the Blood culture 
through outpatient and inpatient departments during period “between” January 2017 to 
December 2017. A total of 58 Staphylococcus aureus isolates were recovered from blood 
culture. All strains classified as MRSA and MSSA based on cefoxitin resistance. ViteK 
and  Micro  broth  dilution  method  were  used  for  antimicrobial  resistance  pattern  and 
biofilm production respectively. Results: Out of 58 non-duplicate Staphylococcus aureus 
isolates,  21(36.20%)  were  community  associated  and  37(63.79%)  were  hospital 
associated,  out  of  which  10(47.62%)  and  22(59.46%)  were  Methicillin  resistant  and 
11(52.38%) and 15(40.54%) isolates were Methicillin sensitive respectively. The biofilm 
producing ability was recorded as high biofilm producer, low biofilm producer and non-
biofilm producer. On the basis of particular classification both community acquired and 
hospital  acquired  based  MRSA  (10,  22)  was  fund  4(40%),  13(59.09%)  High  biofilm 
producers, 1(10%), 4(18.18%) low biofilm producers and 5(50%), 5(22.73%) non biofilm 
producers. On a same hand Out of all 11 and 15 MSSA isolates of community acquired 
infection  and  hospital  acquired  infection  were  found  as  2(18.18%),  4(26.67%)  high 
biofilm producer, 2(18.18%), 4(26.67%) low biofilm producers and 5(50%), 7(46.67%) 
non  biofilm  producers.  The  antimicrobial  resistance  pattern  difference  been  reported 
between  hospital  acquired  and  community  acquired  infection.  The  impact  of  biofilm 
producing ability been found on resistance pattern of all isolates. Conclusion: In our study 
most isolates were hospital associated. The presence of high resistance in IPD isolated 
MRSA isolates represent the impact of some other factors in hospital on antimicrobial 
resistance pattern, and  after understanding the impact of biofilm production on resistance 
pattern helping somehow to fill the gap in between testing and treatment.

world.  However,  MRSA  has  shown  lot  of  changes  in  the  its  epidemiology  as  MRSA  is  now  being  isolated  from 
community patients or people with no risk factors [1]. It is termed as community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) and 
have been reported from different community populations worldwide [2-4]. Having been implicated for potentially life 
threatening invasive infections, Staphylococcus aureus is one of the common agent of bloodstream infections. Blood 
stream infection (BSI)/bacteremiais defined as one or more positive blood cultures presenting with systemic signs of 
infection like fevers, chills, and/or hypotension. Both type of BSIs have been prevailing, community acquired or hospital 
acquired [5] and presented with detrimental clinical outcomes [6]. MRSA has lot of impact on costs and mortality rates 
as treatment is difficult [7-9]. 
 
CA-MRSA strains are clonal entities that differ from hospital-acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA) strains. These strains 
are those isolated outside hospital or within 48 hours of hospital admission, and if it was from a person who had not been 
hospitalized  within  two  years  before  the  date  of  MRSA  isolation  [10].  CA-MRSA  and  HA-MRSA  are  resistant  to 
methicillin (and all beta-lactam antibiotics), but shows differences in epidemiology, lab characteristics, clinical aspects, 
and strategies for management. Spread of infection is not easily preventable as management of these multi drug resitant 
strains is challenging for the clinicians.  Also 20–40% mortality at 30 days has been reported despite an appropriate 
treatment [11]. 
 
S. aureus infections have emerged as dangerous pathogens and costly to treat [12]. MRSA isolates are multidrug-
resistant  (MDR)  as  they  show  resistance  to  macrolides,  tetracycline,  aminoglycosides,  chloramphenicol,  and 
fluoroquinolones along with beta lactams, commonly used for their treatment [13]. 
 
Ability to form biofilm has also been found responsible for increased resistance against antimicrobial. It is assumed 
that biofilms contribute to >80% of infections in humans [14]. Colonization of medical surfaces, such as catheters and 
other  devices,  leads  to  healthcare-associated  blood  stream  infections.  Biofilm  formation  is  a  virulence  factor  in 
bacterimia because bacterial cells in biofilm are more resistant for antibacterials and host immune factors [15]. The aim 
of this study was to evaluate the capacity of biofilm producer and non producer MRSA to cause infections in community 
or hospital associated blood stream infections and impact on antimicrobial resistance pattern to improvise testing and 
treatment. Although Screening, testing and antibiotics have been upgraded, MRSA remains a major etiological agent for 
bacterimia. It is challenge to manage, especially in patients at high risk of complications. Therefore the main aim of this 
study  was  to  investigate  the  capacity  of  clinical  strains  of S.  aureus to  form  biofilms  and  impact  on  antimicrobial 
resistance pattern to fill the gap between testing and treatment. 
 
MATERIAL AND METHODS 
Study Type- Cross Sectional Study. 
Inclusion Criteria- All S. aureus isolated blood samples. 
Sample Size- Sample Size was calculated with the help of confidence level, confidence interval and targeted population 
by using survey software. Where confidence level was 95%, confidence interval was 5% and the targeted population was 
60000. As study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital having patients from highly crowded area between 10 kms. 
Ethical Clearance:- Ethical clearance been taken from IEC of Jamia Hamdard. 
 
MRSA – How to isolate and confirm in lab? 
All the samples obtained in the microbiology laboratory were processed as per standard operative procedures for 
routine isolation and identification of Staphylococcus aureus. Positive blood cultures were taken out from Bactalert and 
subcultured on 5% sheep blood agar and MacConkey agar media and incubated at 37°C aerobically. The growth was 
identified as Staphylococcus aureus by using conventional biochemical methods and Vitek - 2 automated identification 
system according to manufactures manual [16]. Strains were stocked in Di-methylesulfoxide (DMSO) for short time 
storage and at -80oC for long term storage storage in deep refrigerators. 
 
MRSA – Detection in lab. 
MRSA was detected by using cefoxitin (30 μg) disc as per Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) 
guidelines [18]. S. aureus strains were inoculated on nutrient agar and incubated aerobically for 6-8 hours. A suspension 
was made from growth of these strains. Turbidity was matched with 0.5 Mac Farland Standards. A lawn culture was 
prepared on the plate of Mueller-Hinton agar (MHA). Cefoxitin discs were placed and incubated for 24 hours aerobically 
at 35°C. After incubation the plates were examined for zone of inhibition around the cefoxitindisc. Zone of inhibition 
≥22 mm was read as sensitive and not included in the study, whereas ≤21 was reported as resistant and confirmed as 
MRSA and included in the study. 
 
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of MRSA 
Kirby  Bauers  disc  diffusion  method  was  used  to  measure  antimicrobial  susceptibility  testing  and  MICs  was 
confirmed byVitek 2 compact system. Antibiotics (Hi Media) tested were: benzylepenicillin, oxacillin, clindamycin, 
cotrimoxazole, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, linezolid, vancomycin and tigecycline [17]. For Vitek 2 suspension was 
prepared and interpreted as per manufacturer instruction manual.

| MRSA was detected by using cefoxitin (30 μg) disc as per Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)               |
| guidelines [18]. S. aureus strains were inoculated on nutrient agar and incubated aerobically for 6-8 hours. A suspension |
| was made from growth of these strains. Turbidity was matched with 0.5 Mac Farland Standards. A lawn culture was           |
| prepared on the plate of Mueller-Hinton agar (MHA). Cefoxitin discs were placed and incubated for 24 hours aerobically    |
| at 35°C. After incubation the plates were examined for zone of inhibition around the cefoxitindisc. Zone of inhibition    |
| ≥22 mm was read as sensitive and not included in the study, whereas ≤21 was reported as resistant and confirmed as        |
| MRSA and included in the study.                                                                                           |

| Kirby Bauers disc diffusion method was used to measure antimicrobial susceptibility testing and MICs was                  |
| confirmed byVitek 2 compact system. Antibiotics (Hi Media) tested were: benzylepenicillin, oxacillin, clindamycin,        |
| cotrimoxazole, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, linezolid, vancomycin and tigecycline [17]. For Vitek 2 suspension was        |
| prepared and interpreted as per manufacturer instruction manual.                                                          |

Detection of biofilm production - Microtiter plate (MTP) method [18] 
Brain heart infusion broth supplemented with 2% glucose and 2% sucrose was inoculated with MRSA isolates and 
inubated  for  6-8 hrs  at 37oC.  The  growth  was  diluted  1:100  in  medium,  and  sterile, 96  well  micro  titer  plate  was 
inoculated with 150 µl of this cell suspension and incubated at 37oC for 48 hours without shaking. Thereafter wells were 
washed three times, with 300µl of distilled water.  Subsequently plates were dried and stained with 300µl of 2% crystal 
violet solution in water for 45 min. Washing was repeated in the same manner. 
 
Wells  were  destained  by  adding  200µl  of  ethanol-acetic  acid  (95:5,  vol/vol)  so  that  quantitative  analysis  of 
production of biofilm can be done. From each well 100 microliters was transferred to a new microtiter plate, and Optical 
density; OD, of crystal violet present in the destaining solution was measured at 570 nm using a micro titer plate reader., 
uninoculated medium was ss a control. The mean OD  value from the control wells was subtracted from the mean 
570
OD value of tested well. Picture -1

Statistical analysis 
Microsoft excel sheet was used to calculate and record the data. Data were read, calculated and analyzed statistically 
by SPSS software. For calculation of significant levels Chi-square test was used. Statistically significant P values were 
taken as <0.05. 
 
RESULTS 
Distribution of Staphylococcus on the basis of area of isolation (community versus hospital) 
A total of 58 Staphylococcus aureus were obtained from blood culture. 37(63.79%) strains were isolated from the 
hospital and 21(36.21%) were community acquired strains. Table 2

Antimicrobial susceptibility of MRSA and MSSA isolates- Graph 2 
In comparison of antimicrobial pattern of MRSA and MSSA isolates, we found mrsa were more resistant for in 
Gentamycin, Erythromycin, Clindamycin, Linezolid and Tigecycline. The HA- MRSA strain were found highly resistant 
than compared to CA-MRSA Similarly HA-MSSA were found to be more resistant than CA-MSSA. We found high 
MRSA strains were more resistant for Gentamycin, Erythromycin, Clindamycin, Linezolid and Tigecycline. The ratio of 
resistance for HA- MRSA to CA – MRSA for gentamycin was 31.82%: 20% and for HA-MSSA to CA-MSSA was 
13.33%: 9.09%. Similarly for Erythromycin 86.36%: 70% in MRSA and 40%, 36.36% in MSSA. For clindamycin 50%: 
40% for MRSA and for MSSA - 20%, 9.09%. Resistance for Linezolid   (13.64%) and Tigecycline (9.09%) was found in 
HA MRSA only. But none of the MSSA strains were resistant for Linezolid and Tigecycline .All the strains were 
sensitive for vancomycin.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 
The inclusion criteria matched 58 cases of BSI between in a period of one year used in this study.  As seen in the 
results section, an overwhelming percentage (63.79%) of all S aureus BSI cases were hospital associated and (36.21%) 
were community associated. As all the blood samples from IPD were taken after 3 days of hospital stay. Which reflects 
the higher hospital associated infection. The study found, the number of MRSA cases from inpatient department (59.46%) 
were more than MRSA been found in outpatient department (47.62%). On a same side antimicrobial resistance pattern, 
biofilm producing ability also been found higher in IPD isolated MRSA isolates and the comparison between biofilm 
producing IPD isolated MRSA then other isolated the same strains been found higher resistance rate for Erythromycin, 
Clindamycin, Tigecyclin and linezolid. 
 
We have found similar kind of results with few studies i.e Athena P. Kourtis at al [18]. and  whereas mostly studies 
shows the higher BIS caused by Staphylococcus aureus related to community associated instead of hospital, i.e. Yasmin, 
M., El Hage at al. [19] As in our study biofilm forming MRSA infection was mostly associated with hospital infection 
which is similar to the study conducted by Jeong-Ok Cha at. Al [20] which represent the hospital serves more suitable 
environment for biofilm production may be related to various healthcare associated risk factor. The Hospital associated 
MSSA also produces higher biofilm in comparison to other leading the result in a right direction. However, among the 
community associated cases, approximately 45% of the cases revealed the biofilm producing ability suggests the biofilm 
formation may be troublesome in community as well as healthcare. 
 
S. aureus has been reported as most common cause of BSI infections. Its way up to high mortality due to increasing 
antimicrobial  resistance  is  being  documented  every  day  in  India.  Genetic  modifications  are  held  responsible  for 
increasing antimicrobial resistance, and other virulence factors. In our study also, Staphylococcus aureus was found most 
prevalent etiological agent of blood stream infections. It was found to be causing more infections in hospital (63.79%) 
than in community (36.21%). MRSA strains were more prevalent in hospital. Whereas MSSA were isolated more from 
community samples. Hospital strains were more resistant for antibiotics than community strains no matter it was MRSA 
or  MSSA.  An  inverse  association  was  found  between  biofilm  production  and  antimicrobial  sensitivity.  Biofilm 
production was also noted to be higher in HA- strains than CA –strains and so the resistance for antibiotics, making 
treatment difficult and costly. 
 
In  contrast  to  our  study  many  studies  documented  that  the  higher  BIS  caused  by  Staphylococcus  aureus  was 
community associated instead of hospital [19]. although few studies came out with similar results as of ours [20]. Short 
duration and small sample collection was the limitation of this study. The ability of biofilm production is found to be 
closely related to bacterial survival and virulence and so chronic type of infections are now believed to have some link 
with  biofilms  formation  [14].  Biofilms  are  good  to  protect  S.  aureus  from  host  defenses  and  antibiotics  and  are 
consequently help in its pathogenesis .Similar to our studies biofilm-forming MRSA infection has been reported to be 
highly associated with nosocomial infection by other studies [9, 11]. It might be due to hospital environments and 
healthcare-associated risk factors like catheters which are considered to be more suitable for biofilm formation in BSIs. 
Significant  risk  factors  like  the  presence  of  invasive  devices  and  prior  hospitalization,  antibiotic  use  and  MRSA 
colonization were more common in biofilm-forming isolates. However, among the community cases, nearly half of the

isolates were interpreted as biofilm-producers. This conveys that biofilm formation is a challenge not only for HA-
MRSA but also for CA-MRSA as well. 
 
Biofilm matrix act as physical barrier between bacteria and antimicrobial and bacteria change phenotypically in this 
matrix. As a result, biofilm-associated infections are notoriously difficult to eradicate. Most chronic MRSA infections are 
due to this biofilm state which has important role in their pathogenesis [15]. To overcome the morbidity and mortality of 
S. aureus associated BSI it’s important to fill the gaps between testing and treatment. It is equally important to focus on 
antibiotic stewardship to reduce the emerging pressure for emerging more resistant pathogenic strains of Staphyloccus 
aureus in BSIs. 
 
The best method for treating a biofilm-related infection is by preventing initial infection by proper infection control 
methods. Biofilms significantly increase antibiotic minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) compared to cells in the 
free state [20]. Biofilm-associated infections are most commonly treated by vancomycin. It has been reported that the 
MIC is 10-times higher for biofilm-bound cells than for planktonic, free-floating cells [21]. Then Daptomycin can be 
tried, considered effective at treating even VRSA biofilm-related infections and considered most effective antibiotics at 
clearing S. aureus from an existing biofilm [22]. 
 
It is essential to develop valuable tools like set up quality assurance programmes to control the infections related to 
catheters  and  devices,  as  well  as  training  and  awareness  programmes  for  patients  and  staff,  S.  aureus  vaccine  for 
haemodialysis patients that contribute to reducing blood stream infection infection [23, 24]. 
 
As treatments are only effective for planktonic cells or acute infections, need to develop new therapeutic strategies 
capable of clearing S. aureus in the biofilm state should be fulfilled.  Efforts for development of biofilm inhibitors are 
still in its infancy. While many new approaches such as tiny molecules to prevent formation of biofilm, enzymes to 
weaken biofilm matrix, and antibodies and vaccines that target specific biofilm stages have been in progress but lack 
clinical validation [15]. Host defense mechanisms can also be targeted for treatment. Studies have demonstrated that 
human  milk  oligosaccharides  (HMOs),  modulate  growth  and  biofilm  production  for  several  bacterial  pathogens, 
including MRSA [25]. 
 
To conclude, antimicrobial sensitivity alone is not sufficient for treatment of BSIs due to biofilm production in S. 
aureus and cant solve this threat but prevention by proper screening, sequencing, hospital infection programmes, testing 
for biofilm production and continous research for new strategies to control biofilm production is an urgent need of  hour 
to control BSIs in hospital and community.
