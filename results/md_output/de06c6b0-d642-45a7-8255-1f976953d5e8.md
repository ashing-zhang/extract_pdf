Guidelines  to  annotate  experimental  protocols  by 
using Nanotate tool
 
 
SCOPE 
We  are  manually  annotating  experimental  protocols  in  life  sciences.  We 
focus on the annotation of protocol steps and materials participating in each 
one of them, like i) the Sample(s) tested, ii) Equipment and iii) Reagents. 
This  document  is  about  how  to  install  and  use  the  Nanotate  tool;  give 
examples about what is a sample, equipment, and reagents and how this 
information should be annotated by using our tool. 
 
 
STARTING TO USE NANOTATE TOOL 
Before You Begin: 
●  Use Chrome, Firefox or Safari browser. 
●  Create and be logged into your Hypothes.is account. 
 
1) Go  to  the  homepage  of  Nanotate  tool  (see  fig.1): 
https://nanotate.bitsfetch.com/ 
 

 
Figure 1 
 
2) From the Chrome browser, drag the yellow button “Nanotate” to the 
bookmark bar to start to annotate. 
 
3) After that, choose an open access protocol that you want to annotate. 
(An example is available here: DOI:  10.21769/BioProtoc.47) 
 
4) To start to annotate, first select the text and then click on the Nanotate 
bookmark. See Fig. 2. 
 
 
Figure 2 

5) The Nanotate UI will redirect you to a page where you need to insert 
your hypothesis credentials. See Fig. 3. 
a) The Hypothesis username and 
b) Token.

The reagents used in protocols include buffers, solutions and culture media. 
Some examples: 
 
REAGENTS  Chemical compound/  Glucose, ethanol, glycerol, chloroform, acetic 
Substance  acid, isopropyl alcohol, etc. 
Solutions / buffers  70%  ethanol,  10X  PCR  buffer, 
phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol, etc. 
Cell culture media  Nutrient  media,  minimal  media,  selective 
media, differential media, etc. 
 
 
The step of a protocol is a formal statement describing a task that should be 
done or operated. An example: 
 
Part of the speech  Source 
“Wash worms off plates with M9 buffer and collect them in 15-ml  doi: 10.21769/BioProtoc.47 
Corning tubes.” 
 
HOW TO ANNOTATE 
The annotators should focus on annotating the “procedure section” where 
the steps are listed in numerical order. 
  
The annotation UI includes: 
●  tag box: add one or multiple tags from the available options (sample, 
equipment, reagent, software, input, Output, Step). 

| Chemical compound/   | Glucose, ethanol, glycerol, chloroform, acetic   |
| Substance            | acid, isopropyl alcohol, etc.                    |
|:---------------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| Solutions / buffers  | 70% ethanol, 10X PCR buffer,                     |
|                      | phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol, etc.          |
| Cell culture media   | Nutrient media, minimal media, selective         |
|                      | media, differential media, etc.                  |

| Glucose, ethanol, glycerol, chloroform, acetic   |
|:-------------------------------------------------|
| acid, isopropyl alcohol, etc.                    |

| Part of the speech                                              | Source                     |
|:----------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------|
| “Wash worms off plates with M9 buffer and collect them in 15-ml | doi: 10.21769/BioProtoc.47 |
| Corning tubes.”                                                 |                            |

○  Note: this is the only required field to publish an annotation. If the 
selected text does not include any tag the following message will 
be shown (see fig. 5). 
 
 
Figure 5 
  
 
●  ontology  box:  where  annotators  can  link  the  annotated  text  with 
classes from 8 ontologies available in Bioportal. 
●  comment  box:  where  annotators  can  add  any  comment  indicating 
when an annotation or decision was hard to make 
●  publish button: press this button to publish the annotation. 
●  annotation  panel.    In  this  panel  the  annotators  can  visualize  the 
annotations done. The  annotations can  be  edited  or  deleted  at  any 
moment. 
○  Note:  If the annotation is not displayed automatically, then you 
click on the reload button to refresh the page. 
 
 
Annotation of steps 
Each step should be selected and annotated individually.  

●  Note: Please, avoid selecting the entire list of steps for adding a unique 
tag; the database of annotations will consider that the protocol “x” has 
only one Step entry. 
 
●  Note: A step is a message describing how something should be done 
or operated. The steps are not linked to ontology terms. 
 
A  video  about  how  to  annotate  steps  is  available  at: 
https://youtu.be/ZONgbha5AIA 
 
Annotation of samples 
The annotators should annotate only the sample(s) tested in the protocol. 
 
Tagging samples: In steps where a sample is mentioned, this could play an 
“input or “output” role. An example is presented in Fig. 6. There, steps 1 and 
2, the samples highlighted in pink are also the input in their respective steps. 
In both cases the selected text should be tagged as “sample” and as “input”.  
In cases where the sample plays an output role, the selected text should be 
tagged as “sample” and as “output” (See Fig.6, step 16).

Mapping samples to ontology terms: When possible, the samples should 
be linked to ontology terms that come from NCBI Taxonomy or UBERON; 
see video available at: https://youtu.be/9hEJu8YCCto 
 
Otherwise,  please,  choose  an  ontology  term  from  another  ontology 
suggested  by  our  system;  see  video  available  at: 
https://youtu.be/05G7ZuLMP2U 
 
Annotation of equipment 
all  equipment,  instruments  or  consumables  used  in  steps  should  be 
annotated. In steps sometimes is mentioned the capacity of the containers 
used. When this information is available, the annotation should include the 
storage capacity of the containers used and described in the protocol. Some 
examples are: 
 

Part of the speech  Source 
“Wash worms off plates with M9 buffer and collect them in 15-ml  doi: 10.21769/BioProtoc.47 
Corning tubes.” 
“The supernatant from step 7 should be clear. Carefully transfer  doi: 10.21769/BioProtoc.213 
the supernatant to a 12 x 75 mm polypropylene culture tube.” 
“Transfer the sample into a 2.0 ml beat beater tube.”  doi: 10.21769/BioProtoc.3634 
“While DNA is digesting, make your 0.35(w/v) agarose gel mix: 400  doi: 10.21769/BioProtoc.213 
ml 1x TBE + 1.4 g Agarose in a 1 L glass bottle.” 
 
 
Mapping  equipment  to ontology  terms:  When  possible,  the  equipment 
should be linked to ontology terms that come from OBI (first option), BAO, 
EFO or SP; see video available at: https://youtu.be/QyWbAavGEsQ 
 
 
 
Annotation of reagents 
In  steps  are  used  chemical,  biochemical  compounds  and  solutions  (e.g., 
buffers, Cell culture media). Sometimes, chemical compounds are used as 
a solute in a solution. Please annotate the different concentration grades of 
the solutions or mixtures (e.g. 70% alcohol, 100mg/ml lysozyme solution, 1x 
TE buffer, 3M sodium acetate) 
●  Note:  please  do  not  annotate  the  quantity  used  for  reagent.  some 
examples: 
 
●  20 g of peptone instead of 20 g of peptone 
●  1 liter of dH2O instead of 1 liter of dH2O

Mapping reagents to ontology terms: When possible, the reagents should 
be  linked  to  ontology  terms  that  come  from  CHEBI  (first  option),  ERO 
(second option) and SP (third option); see scenario 3. otherwise, please, 
choose an ontology term from another ontology suggested by our system;
