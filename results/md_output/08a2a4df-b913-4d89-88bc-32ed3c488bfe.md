 
HYGROTHERMAL PROPERTIES OF HISTORIC BRICKS FROM 
VARIOUS SITES OF LATVIA 
Introduction 
There  are  available  hygrothermal  simulation  tools  that  allow  to  model  possible 
scenarios  for  optimisation  of  thermal  transmittance  of  historic  wall,  creating  complex 
insulation systems. The accuracy of the results depends on the conformity of the input data 
to the specific design of existing wall. The properties of materials selected in the simulation 
tool should reflect as close as possible the properties of the wall under investigation.  
For theses tools to be widely applicable the material library has to include various 
materials from various regions, thus allowing architects, planners, real estate developers 
and homeowners of Latvia to use the simulation tool with greater reliance on the accuracy 
of the simulation results. 
In order to obtain a result in mathematical modelling programmes simulating the 
humidity transfer processes, which would reflect the situation as close to the real conditions 
as possible, the database built into the modelling programme should be supplemented with 
materials specific to the Latvian construction periods and obtained in different locations. 
Samples  from  different  regions  of  Latvia  were  collected  during  brick  collection 
(see Fig. 1 tab. 1).

To determine bulk density, the bulk volume and the dry mass must be determined. 
For the determination of the dry mass, samples were oven dried in the 105 ° C, until the 
constant mass of the samples is reached. Mass was assumed to be constant, when it doesn’t 
change more than 0,2 % over the 24 h period. For the determination of the volume three 
methods  were  used.  First  method  was  hygrostatic  weighing,  second  method  was 
measurements of sample dimensions using a caliper and the third was immersion method. 
Hygrostatic weighing was used on the full-size bricks, and was done in three steps: 
1)  Brick was saturated with water; 
•  This is done, to avoid water uptake by the brick during weighing; 
2)  Weight of the saturated brick was determined (in the air); 
3)  Weight of the brick was determined (immersed under the water); 
•  Brick in hanged under the scale, and the determined weight is lower due to buoyance. 
To determine the bulk volume of the samples, equation (1) was used: 
(m −m )
  V = s sw   (1) 
s
ρ
w
where 
V  – bulk volume of sample, cm3 
s
m - weight of the saturated sample, g 
s 
m - weight of the saturated sample, when weighted under the water, g 
sw 
ρ - density of the water, g/cm3. 
w 
Immersion method was used for the cut-out samples of the brick and was performed 
in three steps: 
1)  Filling the container with water, up to the rim; 
2)  Immersion  of  the  water  saturated  sample  into  the  water  filled  container,  while  the 
overflowing water is collected, in another container; 
3)  The overflowing water volume equals the volume of the sample; 
4)  Weighing of the collected overflowing water; 
5)  Calculating of the overflowing water volume, (assuming that 1 g of water equals 1cm3 of 
water, the mass of water in grams equals the volumes of sample in cm3).  
Prior to determination of the sample volume by immersion method, the samples had 
to  be  conditioned  by  saturation  with  water.  After  the  samples  were  saturated,  for 
determination of the volume two different size cups were used. Smaller cup was filled with 
the water, up to the rim and put into the larger cup, after that the brick sample was immersed 
into the smaller cup, with the help of an adhesive tape. The overflowing water from the 
smaller  cup  was  collected  into  the  larger  cup,  and  the  mass  of  overflown  water  was 
determined. 
To calculate the bulk density equation (2) was used: 
m
  ρ = d  (2) 
s
V
s
where 
m  - Dry mass of the sample [g]; 
d
V  – Bulk volume of sample [cm3]; 
s
ρ  - Bulk density of the sample [g/cm3]. 
s
The average value of the bulk density was used for further calculations.

To determine open porosity, samples were saturated with water under the vacuum. 
Vacuum saturation was used to determine maximum  saturation of the samples. For the 
vacuum saturation a desiccator filled with water and vacuum pump CVC 3000 vacuubrand 
was used (fig. 2.). The samples were kept under approximately 3 mBar pressure until the 
constant mass was reached. To determine open porosity, the equation (3) was used:

Vapor permeability 
Vapor permeability test (cup test method) are performed according to the standard 
EN ISO  12572  Hydrothermal  performance  of  building  materials  and  products  – 
Determination of water vapour transmission properties. 
For the cup test method 3 samples of the brick are used in the cut sizes of 7 x 7 x 1 
cm. Samples are installed in the lids of the cups, with the help of a wax (fig. 4.). Test is 
repeated two times, first time in low humidity conditions (Dry-cup test) and the second time 
in high humidity conditions (Wet-cup test). 
   
a)  b) 
Figure 4. Cup tests a) sample installed in the lid of a cup b) cups inserted in the controlled environment 
For the Dry-cup test silica gel desiccant is used, to keep low (5 %) relative humidity 
inside the cup. The desiccant is poured in the bottom of the cups and the cups are inserted 
in the climatic chamber TH-G-1000 with the constant temperature of 23 C° and relative 
humidity 35 %. For the Wet-cup test saturated salt solution of KH2PO4 is used, to keep high 
(96 %) relative humidity inside the cups and the cups are inserted in climatic chamber with 
constant temperature 23 C° and relative humidity 65 %. To calculate water vapour resistance 
factor, increasing mass of the cups in the case of Dry-cup test, or decreasing mass of the 
cups in the case of Wet-cup test, are determined, by the weighing of the cups over the period 
of time. Mass increase/decrease of the cup indicates how much water vapour is passed 
through the samples, due to the difference in the water vapour pressure in climatic chamber 
and cups caused by the difference in relative humidity inside the cups and in the climatic 
chamber. Several equations are used to calculate water vapour resistance factor. The main 
equations are showed below: 
Density of water vapour flow: 
G
  g =   (4) 
A
where 
g – density of water vapour flow, kg/(m2·s) 
A – surface area of the sample (exposed to vapour transfer), m2 
G – slope of the mass plotted as a function of time (cup mass increase/decrease), 
kg/s.

and pre-conditioning, side edges of the samples are sealed with the aluminium tape, to 
protect samples from drying out sideways. The top and bottom part of the sample  is left 
uncovered. The prepared samples were put into water, and only up to 5 mm of the bottom

water contact (fig. 5.).

During the free water uptake test mass of the samples is  determined periodically 
with decreasing frequency of period. In the beginning of the test, when the free water uptake 
happens faster, the mass is determined with a higher frequency (from 5 min. interval to 1 h 
interval), when test progresses, the weighing interval can be as long as 24 h. Test frequency 
and duration of the test varies for different bricks due to different material properties. 
The main results of the free water uptake test is a water uptake coefficient, capillary 
saturation level and suction curve, with corresponding boundary conditions. 
Moisture storage 
Two methods are used to determine water storage properties. In hygroscopic range 
a desiccator method is used to determine sorption curves, and in over-hygroscopic range, 
the pressure plate method is used to determine water retention curve. 
Desiccator method are performed according to the standard EN ISO 12571:2013.

In total 10 samples with cut out size of 4 x 4 x 1 cm are used for each brick to 
determine sorption curves with desiccator method. Before the test samples are conditioned, 
by oven drying until the constant mass is reached, indicating that the samples are dry. Then 
the samples are divided in two groups with 5 samples in each group. One group of the 
samples is inserted in the desiccator with highest relative humidity (96 %) and the other 
group is inserted in the desiccator with the lowest relative humidity (7.38 %) (fig. 6). When 
the equilibrium is reached, the samples are weighed and moved to the next desiccator with 
lower or higher relative humidity, respectively, from 7.38 % to 32.9 %, and from 96 % to 
84.7 %. The moving of the samples is continued until both groups of the samples have 
reached the equilibrium state in each of 5 relative humidity environments. Weighing results 
of the sample group moving from lowest relative humidity to higher relative humidity are used 
to obtain adsorption curve and the weighing results of the sample group moving from the 
highest relative humidity to the lower relative humidity are used to obtain desorption curve.

Pressure plate method is similar to desiccator method, but instead of the different 
relative humidity, a different pressure levels are applied to the test samples. Equilibrium of 
the samples is achieved when there is no water flow from the pressure chamber outlet. With 
the desiccator method moisture storage are expressed as the dependence of the relative 
humidity, but with the pressure plate method as the dependence of the capillary pressure.

same formula is used to calculate MC after the equilibrium of the samples is reached at each 
pressure. Two pressure plate chambers are used in this test. To increase testing procedure, 
both pressure chambers are used in parallel with four different samples in each chamber. In 
total 8 samples with cut out size of 4 x 4 x 1 cm are used in pressure plate method. Before 
the  test  samples  are  saturated  for  1  month  by  partially  immersing  them  in  the  water. 
Saturated samples are placed on the ceramic plates; and the kaolin clay and the filter paper 
are used to provide better contact between samples and the plates. Ceramic plates together 
with samples are inserted into a pressure chamber and the pressure is applied (fig. 7.). When 
the pressure is applied to the chamber, the samples are drained until the equilibrium is 
reached. When the equilibrium is reached, the samples are weight and the applied pressure 
increased to the next step. In total 5 different pressures are applied: 0.1 bar, 0.3 bar, 4 bar, 
8 bar and 15 bar.

Drying curve 
To determine a drying curve a non-isothermal combined vapour and liquid transfer 
testing method, developed in Dresden University of Technology, is used. In this method 
samples are conditioned by submerging in the water, until the effective saturation is reached. 
After conditioning, the brick samples are placed in the drying cabinet and measurements are 
made periodically to record changes in the weight and surface temperature of the samples. 
In the drying the cabinet flowing air above the samples is maintained, temperature and 
relative humidity is monitored. The placement of the samples inside the cabinet are managed 
in the manner, so that only the top surface of these samples are exposed to the moving air 
above these samples (fig. 8.).  
 
Figure 8. Samples in drying cabinet 
Results of the drying test is a drying curve and corresponding boundary conditions, 
that are mainly used to calibrate the relevant Delphin material file (see chapter 3.). 
Specific heat capacity and heat conductivity 
Thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity are determined with the ISOMET 
2114 from Applied precision. Surface probe IPS 1105 with the measurement range from 
0.3 to 3 W/(m·K) is used. Precision of the measurements are 3 % of reading + 0.001 W/(m·K) 
for thermal conductivity and 3 % of reading + 1.103 J/(m3·K) for the volume heat capacity. 
Prior to the test the brick samples are oven dried in 105 C°. After preparing  the bricks 
samples for the test, the brick samples are placed in desiccator, and measurements are 
performed with ISOMET 2114. 
Rsults are included in separate excel file, with all the single value results in sheet1 
and individual sheet for each curve.
