OSINT Tool: Generate username lists from companies on LinkedIn.
This is a pure web‑scraper, no API key required. You use your valid LinkedIn username and password
to login, it will create several lists of possible username formats for all employees of a company you
point it at.
Here’s what you get: ‑ first.last.txt: Usernames like Joe.Schmoe ‑ f.last.txt: Usernames like J.Schmoe
‑ flast.txt: Usernames like JSchmoe ‑ firstl.txt: Usernames like JoeS ‑ first.txt Usernames like Joe ‑
lastf.txt Usernames like SchmoeJ ‑ rawnames.txt: Full name like Joe Schmoe ‑ metadata.txt CSV file
which is full_name,occupation
Optionally, the tool will append @domain.xxx to the usernames.

Examples
You’ll need to provide the tool with LinkedIn’s company name. You can find that by looking at the
URL for the company’s page. It should look somethinglike https://linkedin.com/company/
targetco. It may or may not be as simple as the exact name of the company.
Here’s an example to pull all employees of targetco:
1 $ python linkedin2username.py -c targetco
Here’s an example to pull a shorter list and append the domain name @targetco.com to them:
1 $ python linkedin2username.py -c targetco -d 5 -n 'targetco.com'
Tips
Use an account with a lot of connections, otherwise you’ll get crappy results. Adding a couple con‑
nections at the target company should help ‑ this tool will work up to third degree connections. Note
that LinkedIn will cap search results to 1000 employees max. You can use the features ‘–geoblast’ or
‘–keywords’ to bypass this limit. Look at help below for more details.
Toubleshooting
When LinkedIn changes things, the tool may break. The API used here is not documented, and it may

You can try the --proxy flag to inspect traffic with Burp. Right now, it is not inspecting the logins
from the Selenium browser as you can see pretty clearly what is happening there.
