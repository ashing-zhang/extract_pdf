Authors’ contributions: Brunel University London (BUL) is a linked third party to Public Health England 
to contribute to the EU project Human Biomonitoring for the EU (HBM4EU; https://www.hbm4eu.eu).  
BUL’s role in this project is to conduct case studies of mixture risk assessment. AK developed the 
concept for these case studies and selected bisphenol A as one of several substances to be evaluated. 
AK and OVM developed the systematic review protocol. AK, OVM, AB and SE piloted the screening of 
relevant  studies,  data  extraction  and  risk-of-bias  evaluations.  MS  provided  statistical  support  in 
interpreting risk-of-bias questions for epidemiological studies during this piloting and advice regarding 
methods to derive reference doses for mixture risk assessment.

6.  Rationale 
Current chemical regulations operate almost exclusively on a chemical-by-chemical basis. There is 
concern that this approach may not be sufficiently protective if two or more chemicals have the same 
toxic effect (Evans et al., 2016). Methods for the routine consideration of mixture effects in chemical 
risk assessment and regulation are currently being elaborated. One aspect of this process is the 
identification of so-called priority mixtures – mixtures composed of chemicals that jointly affect the 
health outcomes of concern. 
One health outcome of concern is the decline in male reproductive health. There are reports in the 
literature suggesting that bisphenol A contributes to these declines. Bisphenol A is an androgen 
receptor antagonist and has been shown to act together with other such antagonists when present in 
mixtures (Kortenkamp 2020). An adverse outcome pathway network for anti-androgenic chemicals 
was constructed to decide which chemicals to group together for mixture risk assessments with male 
reproductive health as the outcome (Kortenkamp 2020). This analysis also revealed that declines in 
semen quality are a critical endpoint to judge risks to male reproductive health. 
Bisphenol A is a phenolic chemical that leaches out from polycarbonate plastic items. It has entered 
the food chain with widespread human exposure to this chemical. 
To conduct a mixture risk assessment, it is necessary to estimate exposure levels to bisphenol A not 
associated with observable risks to semen quality in men of reproductive age, so-called reference 
doses. To our knowledge, previous systematic reviews of the association between bisphenol A have 
only considered epidemiological evidence (Bliatka et al. 2020; Bonde et al. 2017) and there is therefore 
a  need  to  update  and  complement  these  works.  To  support  this  effort,  a  systematic  review  of 
associations  between  bisphenol  A  exposures  and  declining  semen  quality  is required,  both  from 
human and from animal studies. 
7.  Objectives – PECO statement 
The overall objective of this systematic review is to evaluate whether epidemiological evidence and 
data from animal studies can be used to derive a reference dose for bisphenol A that is protective 
against declines in semen quality. 
This objective will be realised by achieving the following specific aims: 
 
•  Identify literature reporting on associations between bisphenol A exposure and semen 
quality in men of reproductive age. 
•  Identify literature reporting on effects of bisphenol A and semen quality in studies 
involving rats, mice and other mammalian species. 

•  Extract data on these associations from relevant studies to allow assessments of the 
quality of associations, first in a screening and evidence mapping stage, followed by a 
more exhaustive data extraction for the most relevant studies. 
•  Assess the internal validity (risk of bias) of relevant individual studies using pre-defined 
criteria. 
•  Synthesize the evidence using a quantitative approach, or meta-analysis if appropriate. 
•  Rate the confidence in the conclusions drawn from these quantitative analyses. 
PECO statements are given in Tables 1 and 2.

9.  Information sources 
Searches for peer-reviewed articles will be conducted in the following bibliographic databases:  
•  PubMed 
•  Web of Science Core Collection 
•  Scopus 
•  The full text database ScienceDirect 
Although  grey  literature  is  not  strictly  excluded,  the  search  strategy  does  not  include  sources 
specifically targeting the grey literature. 
 
10. Search strategy 
The literature searches include epidemiological studies of associations between bisphenol A exposure 
and declines in semen quality, as well as experimental studies in mammalian species. Due to resource 
limitations, only reports in English will be considered. No restrictions will be placed on publication 
date. 
A  common  search  strategy  was  designed  for  epidemiological  and  animal  experimental  studies 
concurrently on the basis of two strands of search terms combined by the Boolean AND; one for 
synonyms of bisphenol A another for semen parameters (both lists combined by the Boolean OR).  
For the search terms related to the chemical bisphenol A, two lists of search terms were piloted, the 
first using the full list of chemical synonyms for bisphenol as available through PubChem, the second 
by using the ‘Find chemical synonyms’ function of the SWIFTReview Software. We opted for the latter 
list of synonyms of BPA.  
In PubMed, MeSH terms related to ‘Sperm’ or ‘Semen’ were used for semen parameters. For other 
databases, prefix and suffix wild cards were used to detect all terms with roots related to ‘sperm’,

‘semen’  and  ‘semin’.  The  inclusion  of  a  more  general  search  term  related  to  fertility  was  later 
abandoned as it reduced the specificity of the search without any discernible benefits in terms of the 
sensitivity of the search.  
Results of pilot searches for individual search terms and their combinations and the full search strings 
for all four literature databases are given in Supplementary Information “SI file 3 – Search Strategy”.  
11. Study records 
Data management 
Literature and all systematic review processes will be managed and coordinated with the support of 
the freely available online tool CADIMA established in a close collaboration between the Julius Kühn-
Institut  and  the  Collaboration  for  Environmental  Evidence 
(https://www.cadima.info/index.php/area/evidenceSynthesisDatabase).  
Relevance screening 
The list of eligibility criteria will be applied to the merged reference list in two stages. In the first stage, 
only titles and abstracts will be checked for relevance to the study question. AK, OM, ES and AB will 
carry out the screening. As part of an initial consistency check, 200 studies will first be screened by all 
team members in parallel. Discrepancies detected during this pilot stage will be reviewed by all team 
members and the eligibility criteria will be clarified if necessary. Eligibility criteria will be applied to 
the remainder of the merged reference list by one team member. Clearly irrelevant studies will be 
excluded. The full text of the resulting list of included references after title/abstract screening will 
then be examined for inclusion in duplicate, i.e. by two team members independently. The reason for 
exclusion of studies after assessment of the full text will be recorded. 
Multiple reports of the same research (e.g. multiple publications, conference abstracts etc.) will not 
be excluded but instead the methodological information from each of the reports shall be collated as 
part of the data extraction process as one unit of evidence. 
Data collection process:  
A data extraction template in Excel will be used to extract elements relevant for all studies, as reported 
in selected manuscripts. No data interpretation will take place at this stage. 
12. Data items 
From  human  studies  we  will  extract  data  on  bisphenol  A  exposures  suitable  for  estimating  the 
exposure-response relationship. From animal studies we will compile reported data on bisphenol A 
doses associated with no observed adverse effect levels (NOAEL) or effect doses associated with 
predetermined effect magnitudes (benchmark doses) or lowest doses associated with effects (lowest 
observed adverse effect levels (LOAELs). 
The data extraction Excel templates contains the key data extraction elements to summarise study 
design, experimental model, methodology and results as described in the NTP OHAT 2019 Handbook 
for conducting a literature-based health assessment (Table 3, p 29) and reproduced overleaf. These 
were piloted by AB, AK, OM and SE in parallel (Supplementary Information – “SI file 4 – Data extraction 
pilot - human” and “SI file 5 – Data extraction pilot - animal”).

As a result of the piloting of the template, the following items were added to the data extraction 
template in addition to the elements listed above for animal studies: 
•  Was the diet soy-free? (yes, no) 
•  Was consideration given to background contamination with bisphenol A, e.g. by avoiding 
polycarbonate plastic caging? 
•  Were positive controls for declines in semen quality included and did they show activity? 
Revised data extraction templates can be found in Supplementary Information – “SI file 6 – Final data 
extraction template – human” and “SI file 7 – Revised data extraction template – animals”). 
The data extraction workload will be distributed between at least two project team members with 
some overlap to allow the evaluation of inter-rater reliability as a SR quality control measure. 
13. Outcomes 
The primary outcome will be estimates of bisphenol A exposures not associated with adverse effects 
on  semen  quality  parameters,  from  both  epidemiological  studies  and  experimental  studies  with 
laboratory animals. For human epidemiological studies, the outcomes will be operationalised in terms 
of exposures associated with semen quality parameters not significantly different from referents. If 
most  epidemiological  studies  are  cross-sectional,  the  estimation  of  bisphenol  A  exposures  not 
associated with adverse effects on semen parameters will rely on animal studies, due to difficulties 
with ruling out reverse causation in cross-sectional studies. 
For animal studies, the outcomes will be operationalised in terms of NOAELs, LOAELs or benchmark 
doses  (lower  confidence  limits).  Studies  that  cover  the  period  when  germ  cell  populations  are 
established during development (gestational day 7 to post-natal day 8 in the mouse; gestational day 
9 to post-natal day 10 in the rat) will be prioritised as most relevant.  
14. Study evaluation, risk of bias of individual studies 
We will assess the internal validity (risk of bias) of individual studies by using separate criteria and 
considerations for human epidemiological and for animal studies. 
Human epidemiological studies 
Main concerns are risk of bias (understood as factors that affect the magnitude or direction of effect) 
and insensitivity (factors that limit the ability of a study to detect an effect that is there). We will 
examine studies of associations between BPA and semen quality using the procedures detailed by 
Radke et al. (2018). Accordingly, we will conduct evaluations of the following domains: 
•  Exposure measurement 
•  Outcome measurement 
•  Participant selection 
•  Confounding 
•  Analysis 
We will judge each study for each outcome in each evaluation domain in terms of Good, Adequate, 
Poor, or Critically Deficient, following the criteria detailed in Radke et al. (2018). These ratings assess 
the utility of a study for purposes of hazard identification, as follows: 

•  Good represents a judgment that there was appropriate study conduct relating to the domain, 
and any minor deficiencies that were noted would not be expected to influence the study 
results.   
•  Adequate  indicates  a  judgment  that  there  were  experimental  limitations  relating  to  the 
domain, but that those limitations are not likely to be severe or to have a substantive impact 
on the results.   
•  Poor denotes identified biases or deficiencies that are interpreted as likely to have had a 
substantial impact on the results or that prevent reliable interpretation of the study findings. 
Not reported indicates that the information necessary to evaluate the domain question was 
not available in the study.  Generally, this term carries the same functional interpretation as 
Poor for the purposes of the study confidence classification.  
•  Critically Deficient reflects a judgment that the experimental conduct relating to the domain 
question introduced a flaw so serious that the study should not be used without exceptional 
justification (e.g., it is the only study of its kind and may highlight possible research gaps).  This 
judgment should only be used if there is an interpretation that the limitation(s) would be the 
primary driver of any observed effect(s), or if it makes the study uninterpretable. 
Details of the protocol used for the assessment of epidemiological studies are given in Appendix 1. 
As in Radke et al. (2018), we will combine the identified strengths and limitations in each domain to 
reach a study confidence classification of High, Medium, Low, or Uninformative.  The classifications, 
which reflect a consensus judgment between reviewers, are as follows: 
•  High Confidence: No notable deficiencies or concerns were identified; the potential for bias 
is  unlikely  or  minimal,  and  the  study  used  sensitive  methodology.    In  general,  although 
classifications are not decided by “scoring,” high confidence studies would reflect judgments 
of good across all or most evaluation domains.  
•  Medium Confidence: Possible deficiencies or concerns were noted, but the limitations are 
unlikely to be of a substantive degree.  Generally, medium confidence studies will include 
adequate or good judgments across most domains, with the impact of any identified limitation 
not being judged as severe. 
•  Low Confidence: Deficiencies or concerns were noted, and the potential for substantive bias 
or  inadequate  sensitivity  could  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  study  results  or  their 
interpretation.  Typically, low confidence studies would have a poor evaluation for one or 
more domains (unless the impact of the particular limitations on the results is judged as 
unlikely to be severe).  
•  Uninformative:  Serious  flaw(s)  make  the  study  results  unusable  for  informing  hazard 
identification.  Studies with critical deficiencies in any evaluation domain will almost always 
be classified as uninformative (see explanation above).  Studies with multiple poor judgments 
across domains may also be considered uninformative, particularly when there is a robust 
database of studies on the outcome(s) of interest or when the impact of the limitations is 
viewed as severe. 

The risk of bias assessment tool was piloted by AK, SE and OVM and results of this piloting exercise 
can be found in Supplementary Information – “SI file 8 – Risk-of-bias pilot – human”. The risk-of-bias 
tool,  together  with  instructions  how  to  rate  each  element  of  the  protocol  in  terms  of  the  risk 
categories can be found in Supplementary Information – “SI file 10 – Final risk-of-bias tool – human”. 
Experimental studies with animals 
To appraise the internal validity of studies, we will use the internal validity appraisal protocol (risk of 
bias assessment) for BPA detailed in EFSA (2017, 2019) which was developed along the lines of the 
NTP OHAT Risk of Bias Tool, as described in the NTP OHAT 2019 Handbook for conducting a literature-
based health assessment, p 33. 
EFSA (2019) defined key elements for their BPA assessment, as follows: 
•  Can we be confident in the exposure characterisation, in terms of purity of test chemical, its 
consistent administration and absence of contaminations? 
•  Can we be confident in the outcome assessment, in terms of blinding of the assessors? 
•  Was the number of animals per dose group sufficient? 
To assess specific quality issues related to studies of BPA and semen quality, we will use the following 
additional key elements: 
•  Use of polycarbonate-free caging 
•  Use of phytoestrogen-free chow 
•  Demonstration that a positive control was effective 
It is known that BPA can leach from polycarbonate caging and obscure the effects of administered 
BPA. Similarly, the use of phytoestrogen-containing chow will introduce hormonal disturbances which 
may mask the effects of BPA on semen quality. Inclusion of a positive control (often ethinylestradiol 
or diethylstilbestrol) demonstrates the proficiency of the investigators to detect changes in semen 
quality and shows that the experimental system is sufficiently sensitive. 
We will score each element using the NTP OHAT scores, as follows: 
++ definitely low risk 
+ probably low risk 
~ probably high risk 
~~ definitely high risk 
A study that fails a key element will not be evaluated further. We will adopt the system in EFSA (2019) 
to rate each study in terms of three Tiers, with Tier 1 signifying the highest confidence, as follows: 
Tier 1 (high confidence) 
All three EFSA key elements and all three additional key elements are scored + or ++ AND 
No more than 1 question not addressing these key elements (EFSA 2019, Table 2, p 8) is scored ~ or 
~~ 
Tier 2 (medium confidence) 
All combinations not covered in Tier 1 or Tier 3 

Tier 3 (low confidence) 
Any one of the three EFSA key elements and the additional key elements is scored ~ or ~~ OR 
More than 50% of the questions not addressing these key elements (EFSA 2019, Table 2, p 8) are 
scored ~ or ~~ 
The risk of bias assessment tool was piloted by AK, SE, OVM and AB and results of this piloting exercise 
can be found in Supplementary Information – “SI file 9 – Risk-of-bias pilot – animal”. The risk-of-bias 
tool,  together  with  instructions  how  to  rate  each  element  of  the  protocol  in  terms  of  the  risk 
categories can be found in Supplementary Information – “SI file 11 – Final risk-of-bias tool – animal”.  
Regarding the external validity of the endpoint measured in animal studies for human health, we will 
assume that measures of declining semen quality in animals are directly relevant to human health. 
15. Data synthesis 
A systematic narrative synthesis will be provided with information presented in the text and tables to 
summarise and explain the characteristics and findings of the included studies. This will only consider 
human epidemiological studies rated as high or medium confidence, and experimental animal studies 
rated as high confidence (Tier 1). Summary tables with characteristics of eligible studies will follow the 
same template as that described in EFSA (2019) and reproduced below.

To  enable  quantitative  comparisons  between  bisphenol  A  exposures  in  human  studies  and 
experimental studies with animals, we will convert urinary bisphenol A levels into daily intakes for 
humans by employing the toxicokinetic model detailed in Koch et al. (2012). 
16. Meta-biases 
It is not planned to analyse meta-biases. 
17. Confidence in cumulative evidence, evidence synthesis 
The evidence synthesis will be guided by two separate questions, one of a qualitative, the other of a 
quantitative nature: 
Qualitative – how reliable is the evidence linking BPA with declines in semen quality, from both human 
and animal studies? This will require methods for weighing evidence from different lines of evidence 
(here: human and animal studies) (EFSA 2017a).

Quantitative – can we identify ranges of BPA exposures not associated with declines in semen quality? 
This will require methods for integrating evidence (EFSA 2017a). The integration will be achieved by 
comparison of each line of evidence to derive a NOAEL or benchmark dose. Quantitative comparisons 
will then determine a point of departure for the most sensitive species, taking account of biological 
relevance, reliability and consistency of data. 
In the qualitative evaluation, we will synthesise the human and animal study evidence separately. The 
quantitative synthesis will proceed by a comparison of exposure estimates from human and animal 
studies. 
Following the principles developed in the EFSA (2017a) Guidance on the use of weight of evidence in 
scientific assessments, as implemented in the EFSA Bisphenol A hazard assessment protocol (EFSA 
2017b), in each qualitative synthesis (human studies and animal studies) we will consider aspects of 
an  association  that  may  suggest  causation,  according  to  the  Bradford  Hill  criteria:  consistency, 
exposure–response relationship, strength of association, temporal relationship, biological plausibility, 
and coherence. 
We will distinguish between conflicting evidence (unexplained positive and negative results in similarly 
exposed  human  populations  or  in  similar  animal  models)  and  differing  results  (mixed  results 
attributable to differences between human populations, animal models, or exposure conditions). 
Human studies: qualitative evidence synthesis    
We will synthesise human studies by adopting the framework developed by Radke et al. (2018), which 
is compatible with the OHAT (2019) scheme, as follows: 
Robust evidence from human studies 
A set of high or medium confidence independent studies reporting an association between BPA 
exposure and declines in semen quality, with reasonable confidence that alternative explanations, 
including chance, bias, and confounding, can be ruled out across studies.  The set of studies is primarily 
consistent, with reasonable explanations when results differ; and an exposure response gradient is 
demonstrated.    Additional  supporting  evidence,  such  as  associations  with  biologically  related 
endpoints in human studies (coherence) or large estimates of risk or severity of the response, may 
increase confidence but are not required. 
Mechanistic evidence from exposed humans or human cells, if available, may add support informing 
considerations such as exposure response, temporality, coherence, and MOA, thus raising the level of 
certainty to robust for a set of studies that otherwise would be described as moderate. 
Moderate evidence from human studies 
A smaller number of studies (at least one high or medium confidence study with supporting evidence), 
or with some heterogeneous results, that do not reach the degree of confidence required for robust.  
For multiple studies, there is primarily consistent evidence of an association, but there may be some 
uncertainty due to potential chance, bias or confounding.   
If only a single study is available, there is a large magnitude or severity of the effect, or a dose-response 
gradient, or other supporting evidence, and there are no serious residual methodological uncertainties. 
Supporting  evidence  could  include  associations  with  related  endpoints,  including  mechanistic 
evidence from exposed humans or human cells, if available, based on considerations such as exposure 
response, temporality, coherence, and MOA. 

Slight evidence from human studies 
One or more studies reporting an association between exposure and the health outcome, where 
considerable  uncertainty  exists.    In  general,  the  evidence  is  limited  to  a  set  of  consistent  low 
confidence  studies,  or  higher  confidence  studies  with  unexplained  heterogeneity.  Supporting 
coherent evidence is sparse.  Strong biological support from mechanistic evidence in exposed humans 
or human cells may also be independently interpreted as slight.  This also includes scenarios where 
there are serious residual uncertainties across studies (these uncertainties typically relate to exposure 
characterization  or  outcome  ascertainment,  including  temporality)  in  a  set  of  largely  consistent 
medium or high confidence studies. This category serves primarily to encourage additional study 
where evidence does exist that might provide some support for an association, but for which the 
evidence does not reach the degree of confidence required for moderate. 
Indeterminate evidence in human studies 
No studies available in humans or situations when the evidence is highly inconsistent and primarily of 
low confidence. In addition, this may include situations where higher confidence studies exist, but 
unexplained  heterogeneity  exists  and  there  are  additional  outstanding  concerns  such  as  effect 
estimates of low magnitude, uninterpretable patterns with respect to exposure levels, or uncertainties 
or methodological limitations that result in an inability to discern effects from exposure. A set of 
largely null studies could be concluded to be indeterminate if the evidence does not reach the level 
 
required for compelling evidence of no effect.
Compelling evidence of a lack of association 
Several high confidence studies showing null results (for example, an odds ratio of 1.0), ruling out 
alternative explanations including chance, bias, and confounding with reasonable confidence.  Each 
of the studies should have used an optimal outcome and exposure assessment and adequate sample 
size (specifically for higher exposure groups and for susceptible populations).  The set as a whole 
should include the full range of levels of exposures that human beings are known to encounter, an 
evaluation of an exposure response gradient, and an examination of at-risk populations and lifestages. 
Animal studies: qualitative evidence synthesis 
Animal studies will be synthesised according to the framework used by Radke et al. (2018), modified 
in line with EFSA (2019) as follows: 
Robust evidence from animal studies 
The set of experiments rated as falling into Tier 1 (see above, 14. Experimental studies with animals) 
includes consistent findings of adverse or toxicologically significant effects across multiple laboratories 
and species, where the experiments can reasonably rule out the potential for nonspecific effects (e.g., 
resulting from toxicity) to have resulted in the findings.  Any inconsistent evidence (evidence that 
cannot be reasonably explained by the respective study design or differences in animal model) is from 
a set of experiments of lower confidence (Tier 2 or Tier 3).  At least two of the following additional 
factors in the set of experiments support a causal association: coherent effects across multiple related 
endpoints (may include mechanistic endpoints); an unusual magnitude of effect, or severity; a strong 
dose response relationship; consistent observations across animal strains and species.  Alternatively, 
mechanistic data in animals or animal cells that address the above considerations or that provide 
experimental support for a MOA that defines a causal relationship with reasonable confidence may 

raise the level of certainty to robust for evidence that otherwise would be described as moderate or, 
exceptionally, slight, or indeterminate. 
Moderate evidence from animal studies 
A set of evidence that does not reach the degree of certainty required for robust, but which includes 
at  least  one  Tier  1  confidence  study  and  information  strengthening  the  likelihood  of  a  causal 
association.  Although the results are largely consistent, notable uncertainties remain.  However, while 
inconsistent evidence and/or evidence indicating nonspecific effects (e.g., toxicity) may exist, it is not 
sufficient  to  reduce  or  discount  the  level  of  concern  regarding  the  positive  findings  from  the 
supportive experiments or it is from a set of experiments of lower confidence.  The set of experiments 
supporting  the  effect  provide  additional  information  supporting  a  causal  association,  such  as 
consistent effects across laboratories or species; an unusual magnitude of effect, or severity; a strong 
dose response relationship; and/or consistent observations across animal strains.  Mechanistic data 
in  animals  or  animal  cells  that  address  the  above  considerations  or  that  provide  information 
supporting an association between exposure and effect with reasonable confidence may raise the 
level of certainty to moderate for evidence that otherwise would be described as slight. 
Slight evidence from animal studies 
Scenarios in which there is a signal of a possible effect, but the evidence is conflicting or weak.  Most 
commonly,  this  includes  situations  where  only  low  confidence  experiments  are  available  and 
supporting  coherent  evidence  is  sparse.  It  also  applies  when  one  medium  or  high  confidence 
experiment  is  available  without  additional  information  strengthening  the  likelihood  of  a  causal 
association (e.g., corroboration within the same study or from other studies). Lastly, this includes 
scenarios  in  which  there  is  evidence  that  would  typically  be  characterized  as  moderate,  but 
inconsistent evidence (evidence that cannot be reasonably explained by the respective study design 
or  differences  in  animal  model)  from  a  set  of  experiments  of  higher  confidence  (may  include 
mechanistic evidence) exists. Strong biological support from mechanistic studies in exposed animals 
or animal cells may also be independently interpreted as slight. Notably, to encourage additional 
research, it is important to describe situations for which evidence does exist that might provide some 
support for an association but is insufficient for a conclusion of moderate. 
Indeterminate evidence from animal studies 
No animal studies are available, the evidence is highly inconsistent and primarily of low confidence. In 
addition, this may include situations where higher confidence studies exist, but there is unexplained 
heterogeneity and additional concerns such as small effect sizes (given what is known about the 
endpoint)  or  a  lack of  dose-dependence.  A  set of  largely  null  studies  could be  concluded  to  be 
indeterminate if the evidence does not reach the level required for compelling evidence of no effect. 
Compelling evidence of no effect 
A set of high confidence experiments that demonstrate a lack of biologically significant effects across 
multiple species, both sexes, and a broad range of exposure levels.  The data are compelling in that 
the experiments have examined the range of scenarios across which health effects in animals could 
be observed, and an alternative explanation (e.g., inadequately controlled features of the studies’ 
experimental designs; inadequate sample sizes) for the observed lack of effects is not available.  The 
experiments were designed to specifically test for effects of interest, including suitable exposure 

timing and duration, post-exposure latency, and endpoint evaluation procedures, and to address 
potentially susceptible populations and lifestages. 
Quantitative synthesis: integrating evidence 
To  achieve  integration  of  evidence  to  arrive  at  quantitative  assessment  allowing  us  to  derive  a 
reference dose with respect to endpoint semen quality we will follow the procedure sketched out in 
EFSA (2017). Briefly, qualitative comparisons will be made for each line of evidence (per animal species, 
and human) where it is possible to derive a point of departure (NOAEL, LOAEL or benchmark dose). If 
necessary, NOAELs will be extrapolated from LOAELs by using standard assessment factors (AF = 3). 
These comparisons will be based on high quality studies (high or medium confidence human studies, 
Tier 1 animal studies). We will then select the study (or studies) for the most sensitive species and 
derive a reference dose.

al. 2018) 
exposure  measurement 
For  the  domain,  we  will  use  the  following  guiding  questions, 
reproduced from Radke et al. (2018): 
•  Does  the  exposure  measure  capture  the  variability  in  exposure  among  the  participants, 
considering intensity, frequency, and duration of exposure? 
•  Does the exposure measure reflect a relevant time window?  If not, can the relationship 
between measures in this time and the relevant time window be estimated reliably? 
•  Was the exposure measurement likely to be affected by a knowledge of the outcome? 
•  Was the exposure measurement likely to be affected by the presence of the outcome (i.e., 
reverse causality)? 
For case-control studies of occupational exposures: 
•  Is exposure based on a comprehensive job history describing tasks, setting, time period, and 
use of specific materials? 
For biomarkers of exposure, general population: 
•  Is a standard chemical analytical assay used?  What are the intra- and inter-assay coefficients 
of variation?  Is the assay likely to be affected by contamination?  Are values less than the limit 
of detection dealt with adequately? 
•  What exposure time period is reflected by the biomarker?  If the half-life is short, what is the 
correlation between serial measurements of exposure? 
For rating the exposure measures, we will use the following descriptors (adapted from Radke et al. 
2018): 
Good 
•  Three or more urine samples within etiologically relevant time period (±1−3 mo) and analysis 
includes a summed variable, or similar results seen with each of the metabolites from the 
parent compound and 
•  High proportion (>50%) above the LOD and 
•  Discussion of laboratory QC procedures or no discussion of laboratory QC procedures but 
analysis by an experienced laboratory 
Adequate 
•  Two  or  more  urine  samples  within  etiologically  relevant  period  (±1−3  mo)  and  analysis 
includes a summed variable, or similar results seen with each of the metabolites from the 
parent compound and 
•  High proportion (>50%) above the LOD 
Poor 
•  One urine sample within etiologically relevant period (±1−3 mo) and high proportion (>50%) 
above the LOD 
 

Critically deficient 
•  Measures in urine likely to be affected by differential misclassification (e.g., after disease 
diagnosis) or 
•  Low proportion (<50%) above the LOD 
In addition, we will rate the timing of exposure measurements, by taking account of the specifics of 
spermatogenesis: All the cell divisions that produce mature sperm, occur after puberty. A man’s 
semen quality is influenced by the in utero environment and by events in childhood, before puberty. 
In adulthood, spermatogenesis takes 74 days to complete and requires an additional 12 days of 
maturation as sperm migrate through the epididymis. For short-lived chemicals such as BPA, exposure 
measurements during the critical period of spermatogenesis in utero, before puberty and at least 86 
days before taking semen samples would therefore be ideal. If the study question relates to adult life, 
then  measurements  during  the  period  of  spermatogenesis  in  adulthood  (86  days  before  semen 
sampling) are good, for assessing prenatal exposures, measures corresponding to pregnancy are good. 
Measurements occurring after a man’s fertility problem was recognised are critically deficient.  
outcome  measurement 
For  the  domain,  semen  quality  measurements,  we  will  use  the 
following guiding questions (from Radke et al. 2018): 
For all studies: 
•  Is outcome ascertainment likely to be affected by knowledge of, or presence of, exposure (e.g., 
consider access to health care, if based on self-reported history of diagnosis)? 
For case-control studies: 
•  Is the comparison group without the outcome (e.g., controls in a case-control study) based on 
objective criteria with little or no likelihood of inclusion of people with the disease? 
For rating the semen quality measures, we will use the following criteria (Radke et al. 2018): 
Good 
•  One or more samples collected with instructions regarding abstinence time; abstinence data 
collected and discussed and/or addressed in analysis.  
•  Analyzed within two hours of collection (if collected off site, should be kept at body temperature 
until transfer to the laboratory) 
•  Analyzed by a single laboratory according to WHO standards with analysis and quality control 
procedures described in enough detail to provide assurance of quality standards.  
•  Manual ascertainment of morphology (CASA acceptable for other parameters); presents analyses 
of  concentration  (or  counts),  motility,  and  morphology;  definition/criteria  for  motility  and 
morphology are specified 
•  If all three parameters are not presented, an explanation is provided (e.g. manual ascertainment 
of morphology was not performed). 
 
Adequate 
Same as Good, except:  
 
•  Analysis and quality control procedures are mentioned, but described with limited detail or 

•  Sample collected at home and shipped overnight for analysis and otherwise meets Adequate 
criteria (should be considered critically deficient for motility) or 
•  Use of multiple labs for sample analyses, but documented use of the same protocol. 
 
Poor 
•  One sample collected without consideration of abstinence time in the analysis (unless variability 
in abstinence length is < 2 days) or without mention of abstinence time or  
•  Analysis more than two hours after collection (issue for motility) or  
•  Analysis by multiple labs without documented use of the same protocol or 
•  Analysis methods and quality control not discussed or  
•  Does not present analysis of concentration (or counts), motility, and morphology, and does not 
provide explanation. 
 
Critically deficient 
•  Use of local clinically oriented labs without discussion of procedures and quality control. 
 
participant selection 
For the  domain, we will use the following guiding questions: 
For longitudinal cohorts: 
•  Did participants volunteer for the cohort based on knowledge of exposure and/or preclinical 
disease  symptoms?    Was  entry  into  the  cohort  or  continuation  in  the  cohort  related  to 
exposure and outcome? 
For occupational cohorts: 
•  Did entry into the cohort begin with the start of the exposure?   
•  Was follow-up or outcome assessment incomplete, and if so, was follow-up related to both 
exposure and outcome status? 
•  Could exposure produce symptoms that would result in a change in work assignment/work 
status (“healthy worker survivor effect”)?   
For case-control studies: 
•  Were controls representative of population and time periods from which cases were drawn? 
•  Are hospital controls selected from a group whose reason for admission is independent of 
exposure? 
•  Could recruitment strategies, eligibility criteria, or participation rates result in differential 
participation relating to both disease and exposure? 
For population-based surveys: 
•  Was recruitment based on advertisement to people with knowledge of exposure, outcome, 
and hypothesis? 
 
For rating the participant selection, we will use the following specific criteria for semen quality studies 
(Radke et al. 2018): 

Good 
Selection at setting other than infertility clinic (e.g. population-based, occupational) and all of the 
following: 
◼  Minimal concern for selection bias based on description of recruitment process. 
◼  Exclusion and inclusion criteria specified and would not induce bias. 
◼  Participation rate is reported at all steps of study (e.g., initial enrollment, follow-up, selection into 
analysis sample). If participation rate is not high, there is appropriate rationale for why it is unlikely 
to be related to exposure (e.g., comparison between participants and nonparticipants or other 
available information indicates differential selection is not likely. 
◼  Minimal concern that selection of comparison population introduced selection bias. 
Adequate 
Selection at any setting (including infertility clinic) and all of the following: 
◼  Enough of a description of the recruitment process to be comfortable that there is no serious risk 
of bias. 
◼  Inclusion and exclusion criteria specified and would not induce bias.  
◼  Participation rate is incompletely reported but available information indicates participation is 
unlikely to be related to exposure. 
Poor 
◼  Little  information  on  recruitment  process,  selection  strategy,  sampling  framework,  and/or 
participation or 
◼  Aspects of the recruitment process, selection strategy, sampling framework, or participation raise 
the potential for bias (e.g., healthy worker effect, survivor bias) or 
◼  Study  is  limited  to  men  with  normal  or  only  slight  oligozoospermia  (i.e.  excludes  men  with 
moderate to severe oligozoospermia). Exclusion of only men with azoospermia does not meet this 
criterion. 
Critically deficient 
•  Population selected in such a way that selection bias is likely for example, if cases taken from clinic 
where exposed workers are treated, or from a high-exposure geographic area, while controls taken 
from a different clinic where exposure would be lower. This may include clinic or center-based 
sample of volunteers with known male fertility problems, with comparison to people who have not 
gone through a similar recruitment-selection process. 
 
confounding domain
For the  , we will use the following guiding questions: 
Is confounding adequately addressed by considerations in…  
•  … participant selection (matching or restriction)? 
•  … accurate information on potential confounders, and statistical adjustment procedures? 
•  … lack of association between confounder and outcome, or confounder and exposure in the 
study? 

•  … information from other sources? 
Is the assessment of confounders based on a thoughtful review of published literature, potential 
relationships  (e.g.,  as  can  be  gained  through  directed  acyclic  graphing),  minimizing  potential 
overcontrol (e.g., inclusion of a variable on the pathway between exposure and outcome)? 
Key confounders to be considered in semen quality studies are: 
•  Age 
•  Abstinence time 
•  Smoking history  
•  Body mass index 
•  Chronic disease status (e.g., diabetes, kidney disease). 
•  Possible: Alcohol use and stress also could be considered but are not as well established as 
risk factors compared to the variables listed above. 
 
Following Radke et al. (2018) we will rate the confounding domain as follows: 
Good 
Contains all of the following: 
◼  Conveys  thoughtful  discussion  of  strategy  for  identifying  confounders  including  analysis  of 
different  functional  forms  of  key  covariates,  if  warranted.  This  may  include  justification  for 
inclusion or exclusion of variables (based on a priori biological considerations, statistical analysis 
or  results  in  the  published  literature)  with  the  recognition  that  not  all  “risk  factors”  are 
confounders; 
◼  Inclusion in model not based solely on statistical significance criteria (e.g., p < 0.05 from stepwise 
regression)  
◼  Does not include variables on the causal pathway (intermediaries) in the model 
◼  Shows  progression  of  adjustment  with  different  variables,  presents  other  data  relevant  to 
potential  for  confounding  (e.g.,  distribution  of  variables  by  exposure  category)  or  discusses 
likelihood that confounding or residual confounding could explain the magnitude of observed 
effect; 
◼  Descriptive information for relevant population characteristics/potential confounders presented 
(with amount of missing data noted); 
Adequate 
Contains one of these: 
◼  Conveys some discussion of strategy for identifying confounders;  
or 
◼  Shows  progression  of  adjustment  with  different  variables,  presents  other  data  relevant  to 
potential  for  confounding  (e.g.,  distribution  of  variables  by  exposure  category)  or  discusses 
likelihood that confounding or residual confounding could explain the magnitude of observed 
effect;  
And all of the following: 
◼  Inclusion in model not based solely on statistical significance criteria (e.g., p < 0.05 from stepwise 
regression)  

◼  Does not include variables on the causal pathway (intermediaries) in the model  
◼  Descriptive information for relevant population characteristics/potential confounders presented 
Poor 
◼  Strategy of evaluating confounding is unclear or is not recommended (e.g., based on statistical 
significance criteria only); or 
◼  Descriptive information on population characteristics or potential confounders not presented; or 
◼  Some  residual  confounding  is  likely,  given  the  observed  effect  and  likely  measurement 
misclassification for a confounder present in the study. 
Critically deficient 
◼  Established intermediary(ies) included as confounder(s); or 
◼  Confounding  is  present  and  not  accounted  for,  indicating  a  strong  bias  (i.e.,  key  variable  is 
associated with the outcome and exposure in study and was not accounted for in the analysis), 
and lack of consideration of the confounder could explain the results observed with the exposure. 
 
analysis domain
For the  , we will use the following guiding questions: 
•  Are missing outcome, exposure, and covariate data recognized, and if necessary, accounted for 
in the analysis? 
•  Does the analysis appropriately consider variable distributions and modeling assumptions? 
•  Does the analysis appropriately consider subgroups of interest (e.g., based on variability in 
exposure level or duration, or susceptibility)? 
•  Is an appropriate analysis used for the study design? 
•  Is effect modification considered, based on considerations developed a priori? 
•  Does  the  study  include  additional  analyses  addressing  potential  biases  or  limitations  (i.e., 
sensitivity analyses)? 
 
We will adopt the criteria by Radke et al. (2018) to rate the analysis domain: 
Good 
◼  Analyzes outcomes as either continuous or categorical (with justified cutpoints) 
◼  Quantitative results presented (effect estimates and confidence limits or variability in estimates) 
(i.e., not presented only as a p-value or “significant”/”not significant”) 
◼  Descriptive information about outcome and exposure provided (where applicable). 
◆  Amount of missing data noted and addressed appropriately (discussion of selection issues—
missing at random versus differential—i.e., related to exposure and outcome; if amount of 
missing  data  is  large,  multiple  imputations  or  examinations  by  sensitivity  analyses  are 
necessary) 
◆  Where applicable, for exposure, includes LOD (and percentage less than LOD) and discussion 
of: 
–  Choice of cut-points (if analyzed categorically) 

–  Decision to use log transformation; interpretation of log-transformed variables  
◼  Includes analyses that address robustness of findings, e.g., examination of shape of exposure-
response (explicit consideration of nonlinear possibilities; quadratic, spline, or threshold/ceiling 
effects included, when feasible); relevant sensitivity analyses; effect modification examined based 
only on a priori rationale with sufficient numbers 
◼  No deficiencies in analysis evident. Discussion of some details may be absent (e.g., examination 
of outliers). 
Adequate 
Same as Good, except: 
◼  Descriptive information about exposure provided (where applicable), but may be incomplete; 
might not have discussed missing data, or cut-points, or shape of distribution or 
◼  Includes  analyses  that  address  robustness  of  findings  (examples  in  Very  Good),  but  some 
important analyses are not performed 
Poor 
◼  Descriptive information about exposure levels not provided (where applicable); or 
◼  Effect estimate and p-value presented, without standard error or confidence interval which are 
impossible to estimate or 
◼  Results presented only as statistically “significant”/”not significant”; 
Critically deficient 
◼  Results of analyses of effect modification examination without clear a priori rationale and without 
providing main/principal effects (e.g., presentation only of statistically significant interactions that 
were not hypothesis driven) or 
◼  Analysis methods are not appropriate for design or data of the study.
