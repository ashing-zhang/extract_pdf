Jarvis
Jarvis is an Alfred alternative for Windows 10.
Jarvis is currently under development, and all features are not there yet. Pull requests are currently
only accepted for things like performance/memory optimizations and bugs at the moment until ev‑
erything’s more stable. If there’s a feature that you would like to see in Jarvis, then please submit an
issue.
Jarvis is designed to not require elevated user privileges at any time, and will only index things avail‑
able in the current user’s scope. Indexed data is never transmitted over the internet.
