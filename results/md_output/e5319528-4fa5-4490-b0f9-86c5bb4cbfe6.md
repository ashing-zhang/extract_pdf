1  Introduction 
1.1  Scientific background  
 
Mine tailings represent an environmental liability to the mining industry and must be appropriately deposited in 
tailings storage facilities (TSF). Tailings are mostly formed by non-plastic sands and silts generally deposited in 
slurry form in very loose and saturated states being prone to liquefaction (Gens, 2019). When liquefaction is not 
contained and propagates throughout the deposit, a flow slide results. Since liquefaction propagates very fast, 
large structures may fail without warning in a matter of seconds. Sadly, several accidents due to liquefaction flow 
slides of catastrophic consequences have been a regular feature of tailing dams’ history: e.g. Stava (Italy - 1984), 
Aznalcollar (Spain - 1998), Mount Polley (Canada - 2014), Fundao (Brasil - 2015), Brumadinho (Brasil – 2019; 
Viana da Fonseca et al., 2022).  
The risk of physical instability due to tailings static liquefaction is a major obstacle to the sustainable supply of 
raw materials, including those critical for the green revolution. It is a major obstacle not only for new TSF but also 
for remediation and closure plans of existing TSF, which have to be reanalysed in terms of potential vulnerability 
and eventually stabilised or improved with structural zones. The lack of confidence in these deposits hinders any 
attempt at recycling and re-mining the resources accumulated during historical periods on such structures. The 
failure of these TSF is a geo-hazard, which can lead to serious disruptions in the secure supply of raw materials 
but also major direct effects on nearby communities due to damage, casualties, and significant environmental 
impacts. TSF can be considered as an energy critical infrastructure due to its strong impact on the metals supply 
necessary for renewable energy infrastructures, namely in terms of distribution and storage of electricity.  
Most facilities have disposed tailings in wet form, transporting them by pumping and forming a tailings dam by 
hydraulic fill. Following recent accidents, other deposition modes have been pursued, namely the dry stacking 
disposal of filtered tailings (Davies, 2011), where the filtered material (will lower water content) is compacted in 
massive embankments. These structures still have large uncertainties like their height limits associated with very 
high overburden stress levels. Their design should take into account that the material strength will depend on the 
type of material, degree of saturation and compaction, as well as drainage conditions, effective stresses due to 
loading and/or excess pore pressure generation.  
SAFETY analyses the behaviour of these earth structures when subjected to water percolation during heavy 
rainfall, towards the development of enhanced design methods. 
1.2  Aims and Objectives 
 
The objectives of this data storage report are to describe the testing set-up and procedure as well as to explain 
which data was obtained during the SAFETY centrifuge tests. In particular, this report provides a detailed 
explanation of: 
1.  experimental layout for the executed tests; 
2.  materials and model preparation procedures; 
3.  instrumentation of the model; 
4.  organization of data files.

Data Storage Report 
Chapter 2 is dedicated to the description of the model layout, while Chapter 3 describes the material and model 
preparation procedures. Chapters 4, 5, and 6 comprise the specifications of the instrumentation components 
used in the model.  Appendix A includes the logbook of the experiments.

2  Experimental setup 
2.1  General description of experimental setup 
 
The experimental setup considers a very simple slope prepared by moist tamping as described in section 3.2. At 
an acceleration of 100g, the slope is subjected to water percolation by raising the water table in the left 
boundary while keeping the drain open on the right boundary (Figure 2.1). On the left boundary, the water 
coming from the inlet pipe is distributed by a perforated plate with a geosynthetic (Figure 2.2a). On the right 
boundary, there is a drain to collect the percolated water which is also made by a perforated plate with 
geosynthetic (Figure 2.2b). The water level in the left boundary is controlled by a hydraulic pump that also 
assures the recirculation of water from the outlet to the inlet. 
Before percolation, a cone penetration test (CPT) using a mini-CPT of 11 mm in diameter was conducted on the 
top of the slope to evaluate the soil state. Careful was taken to lower the CPT just on the top of the slope to 
avoid creating a preferential water path during the percolation stage. This test was repeated at the end of the 
centrifuge test (after percolation) to evaluate the change in soil state. 
Before and after testing, the model surface was laser-scanned to better show the differences in the model shape 
due to the percolation. The tests were also instrumented with 10 pore pressure transducers (PPT) and 3 laser 
displacement sensors. 
Figure 2.3 illustrates the SAFETY test setup onboard the platform of the Deltares GeoCentrifuge.

2.2  General data storage principles and organization of data files 
 
The data from SAFETY centrifuge tests are upload to the Zenodo platform (DOI: XXX). Two levels of data are 
provided: 
-  L0: raw data from all instruments (MAT format); 
-  L1: data processed for filtering with a decimation frequency of 100 Hz (CSV format). 
 
In addition to the instrument data, an Excel sheet is provided (labelled as 
Appendix_5_D10_2_GEOLAB_SAFETY_Test1_16May23) including: 
-  Test sequence with an indication of the file sequence; 
-  Sensor locations; 
-  Names of the instrument data files; 
-  Residual values. 
2.3  Definition and application of spatial and temporal reference systems 
 
For all transducer coordinates (pore pressure transducers, laser sensors, and CPT), the origin of the axis system is 
located in the inside corner (on the bottom left) of the strongbox front window. 
All instrumentation is measured simultaneously by the same acquisition system. This system supplied by HBM 
has 56 channels with a simultaneous sampling rate of 100 kHz. 
2.4  Test Programme 
 
In the available data, only one centrifuge test is presented which provided relevant information. The 
instrumentation layout of that model is illustrated in Figure 2.4. The test sequence is summarised as follows: 
-  Spin up the centrifuge up to 100g in steps of 25 g at 1g/min; 
-  Execution of CPT test at 2 mm/s up to 90 mm penetration in the model; 
-  Increase the water level on the left boundary at 0.01 mm/s 
-  Execution of CPT test at 2 mm/s up to 180 mm penetration in the model; 
-  Spin down the centrifuge at 10g/min; 
-  Lower water level.

3  Materials and model preparation 
3.1  Soil 
 
A silty sand with a grain size distribution curve similar to an iron tailing material was used in the SAFETY 
experimental program. For this purpose, 56% of Geba sand together with 44% of Silt (sieved from Baskarp B15 
sand) were mixed, which are two silica based natural soils. Figure 3.1 presents the grain size distributions of the 
two base soils that were mixed to simulate the mine tailings, together with the ones of the obtained mixture and 
original mine tailings. The complete geotechnical characterization of the silty sand is available in Viana da 
Fonseca et al. (2023).

3.2  Model preparation 
 
The model was prepared by moist tamping in four layers. The following procedure was applied: 
1) the shape of the slope was drawn in the strongbox window as well as the separation between layers; 
2) the amount of soil and water for each layer were calculated targeting a void ratio of 1.1 and a water content of 
6%; 
3) the soil and water for each layer were mixed; 
4) the wetted soil was gently compacted manually inside the strongbox following the desired shape of the slope.

Data Storage Report 
pore pressure measurements given in the data files are in kPa. 
4.3  Experimental procedure  
 
Pore-water pressure sensors were calibrated with a pressure regulator with a rated output. The pressure regulator 
itself was calibrated at the national metrology institute of the Netherlands. Data was recorded at a sampling rate 
of 100 Hz. 
4.4  Available data 
 
Both L0 and L1 data files provide the PPT measurements in kPa. While for L0 data files in MAT format no filtering 
or processing was done, for the L1 data files in CSV format the data was filtered with a decimation frequency of 
100 Hz.

5  Instrumentation – Laser displacement sensors 
5.1  Instruments 
 
Three laser distance sensors from SICK, model OD1-B100H50I14, were used to measure the distance from the 
sensor to specific points of the slope. The sensors were installed in a beam above the model (see coordinates in 
Table 5.1) facing the slope face.

5.2  Measured parameters 
 
These sensors measure the distance from the sensor to the next visible point (in the model). The distance is 
measured in millimetres so this is the unit presented in all data files. 
5.3  Experimental procedure  
 
Distance measurements in millimetres were taken at a sampling rate of 100 Hz. From these distances, it is possible 
to calculate the soil settlements/heave in specific points during the experiment by the difference between the 
measured distance in a given instant and the initial distance.

6  Instrumentation – CPT probe 
6.1  Instruments 
 
CPT tests were performed before and after water percolation throughout the model. The mini CPT probe has a 
diameter of 11 mm and was designed by Fugro (cone type: A01F0.5CKEW2) specifically for the Deltares 
Centrifuge. The dimensions of the probe are given in Table 6.1. 
The CPT probe was introduced in the model at the following coordinates in relation to the bottom lower corner 
of the strongbox: x: 80 mm, y: 390 mm, z: 100 mm.

Distance between base of cone and bottom of sleeve   mm  2.7 
Distance between base of cone and centre of sleeve   mm  23.95 
6.2  Measured parameters 
 
The CPT probe is a subtraction-type cone, measuring the tip force (in N), the tip and sleeve friction force (in N), 
and the pore water pressure (in kPa). 
6.3  Experimental procedure  
 
All sensors were calibrated with expert knowledge based on the manufacturer’s calibration certification. The 
linearity of each sensor was checked. Data was recorded at a sampling rate of 100 Hz. At the beginning of the 
experiment, the soil was not saturated so it was not possible to ensure that the porous stone remained saturated 
during the CPT test. 
6.4  Data post-processing 
 
The data provided in L0 and L1 versions corresponds to raw data at the model scale.

Data Storage Report 
To obtain the cone tip stress and sleeve friction stress the following procedure is recommended: 
1)  Calculate the effective cone area and sleeve surface area of the CPTU taking into account the dimensions 
indicated in Table 6.1; 
2)  The sleeve friction force can be obtained by subtracting the tip force at an equal depth from the soil 
surface, which requires manually shifting the data in time; 
3)  The sleeve friction stress can be obtained by dividing the sleeve friction force by the sleeve surface area; 
4)  The tip cone stress can be obtained by dividing the cone tip force by the effective cone area.
