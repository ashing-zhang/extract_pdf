Lesson objectives  
At the end of the lesson, you should be able to:  
1.  apply principles of clinical conversation,  
2.  identify key components of active listening,  

3.  read and use non-verbal cues to steer communication,

Teaching approach: Inverted classrooms, group problem solving, puzzle classroom  
  
For this lesson, you will be working together with other students from another health 
discipline in another country. You therefore need to arrive prepared as you will be working 
in groups using distance communication technologies.  
  
To do prior to the first lesson   
(15 minutes)  
  
●  Join the Slack lesson workspaces (Invitation and link to workspace). You can also 
download the Slack application to your desktop or on your smartphone.  
●  Find the E-mail entitled “ActCom StudentID” that provides your personal student

Student instructions for Groups A – D  
Required material  
●  Laptop or smartphone for reading documents (pdf format).  
●  4G or wifi connection.  
Procedure  
Step 1 – Allocating tasks (15 min)  
You have been placed in groups of 4-5 students and will be working on the group’s topic 
defined on the student list document (ActCom-L1–Student_list).  
  
The first step is to find your local team members. Once your group is formed, please:  
1.  Identify the exercise material placed on Google Drive  

(ActCom-L1–support_material). This is done by opening the subfolder corresponding 
to your group name (letters A to D).  
2.  Open the question template (“ActCom-L1-QuestionX_template” / printed version) 
and read the questions corresponding to your group name.  
3.  Allocate questions to group members and agree on when you will meet again to 
share your findings (plan about 45 minutes).  
  
Step 2 – Collecting and summarizing information (45 min)  
The second step is to work individually to read through the material and find answers to 
your question. Please:  
1.  Read/look at all the provided material linked to your topic and take note of where 
you have found relevant information related to your question.  
2.  Extract a summary of all the important concepts you have found using keywords.  
3.  Draft a written documented response. Shared templates for people from your group 
(docs.google spreadsheets) are available online. The link is in the document folder 
(ActCom-L1-QuestionX_template).   
  
Step 3 – Merge information and prepare restitution with eventual reference documents  
4.  Agree on who will present the collected and summarized material to the rest of the 
class (2 minutes).  
5.  Agree on what support material you will be using to structure the course and make 
key points clear for others. (3 minutes)  
6.  Go through each question and agree collectively on the provided answer and the 
way to present it. If you wish, you can write your answers online on the docs.google 
template (ActCom-L1-QuestionX_template), but any other support is also suitable if 
they are made accessible to students from your class (25 minutes).   
7.  End this part of the exercise at latest at 10.30 CET (12.30 Russian time).

From theory to practice  
Clinical application group exercise (20 minutes)  
Student instructions for Groups E – I  
  
In this exercise, each group is formed by members of all the previous groups. Each member 
has a degree of expertise to contribute to the exercice.   
  
The aim of this exercise is to identify key points that seem important to consider when 
interviewing the patient from the clinical vignette.  
  
  ●  Using the clinical vignette, discuss as a group the following points:  
a.  How would the concept seen in the morning relate to this clinical situation?  
b.  From your readings and the presentations, when interviewing the patient, 
what principles would you apply to help understand the patient presented in 
the clinical vignette?  
  
Clinical vignette  
Kim Longshot, 43 years old, has attended the clinic five days ago for an episode of acute low 
back pain on her husband’s recommendation who is followed by the same osteopath. During 
the past month, she has started feeling epigastric discomfort especially when sitting up. She 
is five months pregnant. She has had some slight vaginal bleeding following her previous 
consultation with the osteopath. Feeling the patient anxious and worried about more than 
her back pain, the osteopath suggested that the situation be tackled by a multidisciplinary 
team.   
  
Kim works as an accountant in a large multinational company. She has a lot of 
responsibilities. She is originally from Hungary but has studied abroad in the UK and has 
now been living in Switzerland for two years.  
  
The patient is seen by four clinicians. Their aim will be to understand her situation, to identify 
and decide on what needs to be addressed or prioritised between her low back pain, her 
vaginal bleeding, her gastric discomfort and any other issues she might be having.   
  

 
    
 
Clinical case interview  
Simulated patient interview  
Instructions for students  
Required material  
●  Smartphone or laptop to connect to Slack and provide live feeds for the interview.  
●  3-4G or wifi connection.  
Process  
Using active communication skills, four volunteer students will interview the patients to 
discover more about her situation. Other students can provide cues, tips and suggestions 
using Slack . These are projected behind the patients for the students interviewing the 
patient to see.  
To do  
●  Log in to the common workspace on Slack  
●  Listen and look carefully for cues  
●  Think of how you would summarize, reflect or question the patient ●  Provide 
advice on Slack using short, succinct, and relevant comments.  
  
     

 
SWOT analysis of active communication  
Instructions for students  
Material  
  ●  Post-it and pen or pencil  
Reflecting  
This exercise will have you reflect on the usefulness and challenges with active 
communication. Using the coloured post-its, write one or two statements on the strengths, 
weaknesses, opportunities and threats of active communication (SWOT analysis). Only use 
precise, short, verifiable statements. Single words are welcome.  
  
S for strengths (Green post-it)  
●  What was gained during the interview that could not have been achieved without 
active communication?  
●  What do you think the patients saw as beneficial in active communication?  
●  What is it about active communication that will have you as a clinician adopt this 
approach?  
  
W for weaknesses (Orange post-it)  
●  What makes active communication difficult to master?  
●  What are the barriers you need to overcome to use active communication?  
●  What are patients likely to dislike about active communication?  
  
O for Opportunities (Blue post-it)  
●  What new perspectives does active communication bring to your views on your 
clinical activities?  
●  What will you be able to achieve with active communication you would not be able to 
without?  
  
T for threats (Yellow post-its)  
●  In what way could active communication threaten your identity, your work or your 
relationship to colleagues or patients?  
Reorganizing and brainstorming  
Once you have listed your statements, walk to the whiteboard and place it on the board. Try 
and match it with similar statements from other students and group them together. Do not 
hesitate to stay and restructure the post-its with other classmates.  
Overview summary  
Once all the post-its have been placed, we will overview their groupings and identify values 
and challenges you are to face with active communication.
