Abstract
This paper proves existence of the long bond, long forward measure and long-term factoriza-
tion of the stochastic discount factor (SDF) of Alvarez and Jermann (2005) and Hansen and Scheinkman
(2009) in Heath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM) models in the function space framework of Filipovi´c
(2001). A sufficient condition on the weight in the Hilbert space of forward rate volatility curves
is given that ensures existence of the long bond volatility process, the long bond process and the
long-term factorization of the SDF into discounting at the rate of return on the long bond and

measures.
1 Introduction
The stochastic discount factor (SDF) assigns today’s prices to risky future payoffs at alternative
investment horizons. It accomplishes this by simultaneously discounting the future and adjusting
for risk. A familiar representation of the SDF is a factorization into the factor discounting at
the short-term risk-free interest rate and a martingale component adjusting for risk. This mar-
tingale accomplishes the change of probabilities from the data-generating (physical) measure P
to the risk-neutral measure Q. More recently, Alvarez and Jermann (2005), Hansen et al. (2008),
Hansen and Scheinkman (2009), Hansen (2012) and Qin and Linetsky (2017) study an alternative
long-term factorization of the SDF. The long-term factorization decomposes the pricing kernel (PK)
process in an arbitrage-free asset pricing model

into discounting at the long-term discount rate λ (yield on the long bond, a zero-coupon bond of
asymptotically long maturity), a process π characterizing gross holding period returns on the long

bond net of the long-term discount rate, and a positive martingale M that defines a long-term

forward measure L. The process B∞ = eλtπ tracks the gross return earned on the long bond from

t+τ t
(2005) originally introduced the long-term factorization in discrete-time ergodic economies. Hansen and Scheinkman
(2009) introduced and studied the long-term factorization in continuous-time Markovian economies
and expressed it in terms of the Perron-Frobenius principal eigenfunction of the pricing operator.
Recently Qin and Linetsky (2017) extended the long-term factorization to general semimartingale
economies. Their martingale approach to the characterization of long-term pricing does not require
a Markov specification and is based on a limiting procedure, constructing the long forward measure
L defined by the martingale M∞ as the limit of T-maturity forward measures QT familiar in mathe-
t
matical finance (Jarrow (1987), Jamshidian (1989), Geman et al. (1995)) as maturity increases. The
long-term discount rate λ and the process π are counterparts of the Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue
t
and eigenfunction of Hansen and Scheinkman (2009) in the sense that in Markovian economies the
process π reduces to the function of the Markovian state, π(X ), where π(x) is the Perron-Frobenius
t t
e−λt
eigenfunction of the pricing operator with the eigenvalue as in Hansen and Scheinkman (2009)
(see also Qin and Linetsky (2016) for further details on Markovian models).

The long-term factorization of the SDF is convenient in applications to the pricing of long-
lived assets and to theoretical and empirical investigations of the term structure of the risk-return
trade-off. In addition to the references above, the growing literature on the long-term factoriza-
tion and its applications includes Hansen and Scheinkman (2012), Hansen and Scheinkman (2017),
Boroviˇcka et al. (2016), Boroviˇcka et al. (2011), Boroviˇcka and Hansen (2016), Bakshi and Chabi-Yo
(2012), Bakshi et al. (2015), Christensen (2017), Christensen (2016), Qin and Linetsky (2016),
Qin et al. (2016), Backus et al. (2015), Filipovi´c et al. (2017), Filipovi´c et al. (2016), Lustig et al.

(2016). Empirical investigations in this literature show that the martingale M is highly volatile
t
and economically significant. Bakshi and Chabi-Yo (2012) provide theoretical and empirical bounds
on the volatility of the martingale component. Christensen (2017) estimates the long-term factoriza-
tion in a structural asset pricing model connecting to the macro-economic fundamentals. Qin et al.
(2016) estimate the long-term factorization in a dynamic term structure model (DTSM) and show
how the martingale component in the long-term factorization controls the term structure of the
risk-return trade-off in the bond market. In particular, they directly estimate volatility of the
∞
martingale M in a parametric DTSM and show how this martingale gives rise to the downward
slopping term structure of bond Sharpe ratios. Lustig et al. (2016) apply long-term factorization
to the study of foreign exchange markets.
While Qin and Linetsky (2017) provide the theoretical framework and an abstract sufficient
condition for existence of the long-term factorization in general semimartingale models without the
Markovian assumption, so far only Markovian model specifications have been investigated in the
literature. The purpose of this paper is to construct the long-term factorization of Heath-Jarrow-
4

Morton term structure models, thereby illustrating how the long-term factorization plays out in
non-Markovian models. We adopt the point of view of Filipovi´c (2001), Carmona and Tehranchi
(2007) and Bjork and view forward curves as elements of an appropriately specified function space.
In particular, we follow the specification of Filipovi´c (2001). In Section 2, after a review of the
HJM modeling framework in the setting of Filipovi´c (2001), we give a sufficient condition on the
asymptotic behavior of the forward rate volatility that ensures existence of the long bond process,
the long forward measure, and the long-term factorization in HJM models. This sufficient condition
is quite natural from the interest rate modeling point of view and yields existence of the volatility
process for the long bond. Our theoretical results are summarized in Theorem 2, which constitutes
the main result of this paper. The proof is given in the Appendix. In Section 3 we illustrate our
results on examples of (generally non-Markovian) Gaussian HJM models, where our assumptions
and their implications can be seen in a transparent way.
The explicit construction of the long-term factorization in this paper furnishes an alternative
mechanism of how the long-term factorizations arises, relative to the original theory of Hansen and Scheinkman
(2009). Their original formulation of the long-term factorization is based on Markov process theory,
and sufficient conditions rely on ergodicity assumptions that furnish the principal eigenvalue and
eigenfunction of the pricing semigroup germane to the long-term behavior. Qin and Linetsky (2017)
give a general sufficient condition for the existence of the long-term limit in general semimartin-
gale models and show how results of Hansen-Scheinkman arise when the information filtration is
Markovian and the pricing kernel is a multiplicative functional of the Markov process generating the
filtration. In contrast to these references, the explicit construction in the present paper illustrates
5

the mechanism of how the long-term factorization arises in non-Markovian HJM models by impos-
ing a condition on the asymptotic behavior of the volatility of the forward curve. The condition is
fully explicit, and the proof shows that under this condition HJM models verify the abstract suf-
ficient condition of Qin and Linetsky (2017) in general semimartingale models. Furthermore, our
Gaussian example shows how in the special case of a Gaussian model with constant parameters the
Hansen-Scheinkman principal eigenfunction construction of the long-term factorization is recovered
from the assumption about asymptotic behavior of forward curve volatility. For empirical analysis
of the long-term factorization on US treasury data we refer to Qin et al. (2016).
2 Long Term Factorization in Heath-Jarrow-Morton Models
The classical Heath et al. (1992) framework assumes that the family of zero-coupon bond processes
{(PT) ,T ≥ 0} is sufficiently smooth across the maturity parameter T so that there exists a
t t∈[0,T]
T
family of instantaneous forward rate processes {(f(t,T)) ,T ≥ 0} such that PT = e−R f(t,s)ds,
t∈[0,T] t t
and for each maturity T the forward rate is assumed to follow an Itˆo process on the time interval
[0,T] driven by an n-dimensional Brownian motion. An alternative point of view on interpreting
HJM models is to treat f as a stochastic process taking values in an appropriate function space of
t
well-defined forward curves. To this end, the Musiela (1993) parameterization f (x) := f(t,t + x)
t
of the forward curve is convenient. Here x denotes time remaining to maturity, so that t + x is
the maturity date. This point of view also allows the volatility function to depend on the entire
forward curve. In this approach we work with the process (f ) taking values in an appropriate
t t≥0
space of functions on R (the state f is a function of time to maturity x, f (x), with x ∈ R ).

Mathematical foundations of stochastic processes taking values in function spaces can be found in
Prato and Zabczyk (2014), and the development of this point of view in interest rate modeling can
be found in Bjo¨rk and Christensen (1999), Bjo¨rk and Gombani (1999) and Bjo¨rk and Svensson
(2001), and Carmona and Tehranchi (2007) and Filipovi´c (2001). In this paper we follow the
treatment of Filipovi´c (2001).
The HJM forward curve dynamics reads:
P
df = (Df + µ )dt + σ · dW . (1)
t t t t t
P P,j
The infinite-dimensional standard Brownian motion W = {(W ) ,j = 1,2,...} is a sequence
t t≥0
F
of independent standard Browian motions adapted to the underlying reference filtration ( )
t t≥0
on the probability space (Ω,F ,P). Here σ · dWP = σj dWP,j . The finite-dimensional case
t t j∈N t t
P
j
arises by simply setting σ ≡ 0 for all j > n for some n. The forward curve (f ) is a process
t t t≥0
taking values in the Hilbert space H that we will define shortly. The drift µ = µ(t,ω,f ) and
w t t
volatility σj = σj(t,ω,f ) take values in the same Hilbert space H and depend on ω and f (note
t t w t
the difference in w and ω; the former is the weight function in the definition of the Hilbert space,
while the latter is an element of the sample space Ω). To lighten notation we often do not show
dependence of coefficients on ω and f explicitly. The additional term Df in the drift in Eq.(1)
t
arises from Musiela’s parameterization, where the operator D is interpreted as the first derivative
with respect to time to maturity, Df (x) = ∂ f (x), and is defined more precisely below as an
t x t
operator in the Hilbert space H .
w
Following Filipovi´c (2001), we next define the Hilbert space H of forward curves and give
w
7

conditions on the volatility and drift to ensure that the solution of the HJM evolution equation
Eq.(1) exists in the appropriate sense (so that the forward curve stays in its prescribed function
space H as it evolves in time) and specifies an arbitrage-free term structure. Let w : R → [1,∞)
w +
be a non-decreasing C1 function such that
∞

w (x)dx < ∞. (2)
Z

We define
H := {h ∈ L1 (R ) | ∃h′ ∈ L1 (R ) and khk < ∞}, (3)
w loc + loc + w
where
2 2 ′ 2
khk := |h(0)| + |h (x)| w(x)dx,
w
Z

′
and h (x) is the weak derivative. That is, H is defined as the space of locally integrable func-
w
tions on R , with locally integrable weak derivatives, and with the finite norm khk . Elements of
+ w
H are equivalence classes. Recall that if h ∈ L1 (R ) has a weak derivative h′ ∈ L1 (R ),
w loc + loc +
then there exists an absolutely continuous representative of the equivalence class h such that
x ′
h(x) − h(y) = h (z)dz. Thus, elements of H have absolutely continuous representatives. We
w
y
R
identify all financial quantities of interest, such as the forward curve, with absolutely continuous
representatives. With some abuse of notation, in what follows we do not make the distinction be-
tween elements of H that are equivalence classes and their absolutely continuous representatives.
w
′
The finiteness of the H -norm imposes tail decay on the derivative h of the function (the forward
w
8

curve) with respect to time to maturity such that it decays to zero as time to maturity tends to
infinity sufficiently fast so the derivative is square integrable with the weight function w, which is
∞ w−1/3(x)dx
assumed to grow sufficiently fast so that < ∞. By H¨older’s inequality, it is easily
0
R
′
seen that |h (x)|dx < ∞ for all h ∈ H . Thus, the absolutely continuous representative h(x)
R w
+
R
converges to the limit h(∞) ∈ R as x → ∞, which can be interpreted as the long forward rate. In
other words, all forward curves in H flatten out sufficiently fast at asymptotically long maturities.
w
We thus have the following result.
Proposition 2.1. If the initial forward curve f ∈ H , then there exists a constant λ such that
0 w

where λ = f (∞) is the long forward rate.

Recall that we always identify forward curves with absolutely continuous representatives of
elements of H . Denote the limiting value of the absolutely continuous forward curve f (∞) = λ.
w 0
Then Eq.(4) immediately follows from the relationship between bond prices and forward rates,
T
PT = e−R f t(u)du.
t
t
We note that Qin and Linetsky (2017) assume that the initial forward curve satisfies Eq.(4)
to derive a long-term factorization for semimartingale pricing kernels with the long bond factor in
the form B∞ = eλtπ . Here in the context of HJM models Proposition 1 is simply an immediate
t t
consequence of the Hilbert space structure assumed for forward curves. From the financial point
of view, the property (4) is natural and only requires that the initial forward curve flatten out
at asymptotically long maturities. While in empirical data we do not observe forward curves
9

at asymptotically long maturity, we do typically observe that the term structure becomes flatter
between 20 year and 30 years. We stress that this behavior of the initial forward curve does not
impose any restrictions on the term structure dynamics, as opposed to, for instance, the “low
variance martingale” (LVM) assumption common in the literature on swap market models (cf.
Gaspar and Pimentel (2016)).
The space H equipped with khk is a separable Hilbert space (Theorem 5.1.1 in Filipovi´c
w w
(2001)). Define a semigroup of translation operators on H by (T f)(x) = f(t + x). By Filipovi´c
w t
(2001) Theorem 5.1.1, it is strongly continuous in H , and we denote its infinitesimal generator by
w
D. This is the operator that appears in the drift in Eq.(1) due to the Musiela re-parameterization.
We next give conditions on the drift and volatility such that the forward curve stays in H as
w
it evolves according to the HJM dynamics. First we need to introduce some additional notation.
Define the subspace H0 ⊂ H by H0 = {f ∈ H such that f(∞) = 0}. For any continuous
w w w w
function f on R , define a continuous function Sf : R → R by
+ +
x
(Sf)(x) := f(x) f(η)dη, x ∈ R .
+
Z
0
This operator is used to conveniently express the celebrated HJM arbitrage-free drift condition.
By Filipovi´c (2001) Theorem 5.1.1, there exists a constant K such that kShk ≤ Kkhk2 for all
w w
h ∈ H0. Local Lipschitz property of S is proved in Filipovi´c (2001) Corollary 5.1.2, which is used
w
to ensure existence and uniqueness of solution to the HJM equation. Namely, S maps H0 to H0
w w
and is locally Lipschitz continuous:
0
kSg − Shk ≤ C(kgk + khk )kg − hk ,∀g,h ∈ H , (5)
w w w w w
10

where the constant C only depends on w.
Next consider ℓ2, the Hilbert space of square-summable sequences, ℓ2 = {v = (v ) ∈
j j∈N
RN |kvk2 := |v |2 < ∞}. Let e denote the standard orthonormal basis in ℓ2. For a sep-

arable Hilbert space H, let L0(H) denote the space of Hilbert-Schmidt operators from ℓ2 to H with
2
the Hilbert-Schmidt norm kφk2 := kφjk2 < ∞, where φj := φe . We shall identify the
L0(H) j∈N H j

operator φ with its H-valued coefficients (φj) .
j∈N
We are now ready to give conditions on the HJM market price of risk and HJM volatility
to ensure that the forward curve stays in the Hilbert space H . Recall that we have a filtered
w
probability space (Ω,F ,(F ) ,P). Let P denote the predictable sigma-field. For any metric
t t≥0
space G, we denote by B(G) the Borel sigma-field of G.

convenience in Appendix.
We are now ready to formulate the long-term factorization in HJM models. First we observe

T F T T F T
nally introduced by Jarrow (1987) and by Geman (1989) and Jamshidian (1989). Under QT the

Qin and Linetsky (2017) define this limit in Emery’s semimartingale topology (see Emery (1979)
and Qin and Linetsky (2017) for the definition of Emery’s distance). To this end, it is first conve-
nient to extend the process PT/PT to all t ∈ [0,∞) beyond [0,T] by considering a self-financing
t 0
roll-over strategy that starts at time zero by investing one unit of account in 1/PT units of the
0
T-maturity zero-coupon bond. At time T the bond matures, and the value of the strategy is 1/PT
0
units of account. We roll the proceeds over by re-investing into 1/(PTP2T) units of the zero-coupon
0 T
bond with maturity 2T. We continue with the roll-over strategy, at each time kT re-investing the
(k+1)T
proceeds into the bond P . We denote the wealth process of this self-financing strategy by
kT

BT, BT = k P(i+1)T P(k+1)T , t ∈ [kT,(k + 1)T), k = 0,1,... . It is clear that BT extends

PT/PT to all times t ≥ 0. As a consequence, the product S BT also extends the martingale MT to

all times t ≥ 0. We continue to use the notation MT for S BT. MT now defines a new probability

14

measure for all t ≥ 0, and we still denote it by QT. With these preparations completed, we are now
ready to formulate the long-term factorization in HJM models.

forward measure (also denoted as L in Qin and Linetsky (2017)) as the limit of the T-forward
measure. The sufficient condition on the forward curve volatility to ensure existence of the long
bond, long-term factorization and long forward measure is a strengthening of Filipovic’s condition
on forward curve volatility in Assumption 2.1 for existence of a solution of the HJM SDE (1) in H .
w
As a sufficient condition for existence of the long-term factorization, we require that the weight
function w¯ in the weighted Sobolev space H where the volatility components take their values
w¯
satisfy the asymptotics (12), a strengthening of Filipovic’s assumption on the weight w in the
definition of the norm of the space H where the forward curves themselves evolve. Alternatively,
w
we can assume that w satisfies the asymptotics (12) and work with this smaller function space
from the beginning. However, this is not necessary, and so we leave the assumptions on the space
of forward curves unchanged and the same as in Filipovic, while imposing the sufficient condition
on forward rate volatility to ensure existence of the long-term factorization. Typical choices of
weight function are w(x) = eαx for α > 0 and w(x) = (1 + x)α for α > 3, which both satisfy the
asymptotics (12). An example that satisfies Eq.(2) but not (12) is w(x) = (1 + x)3 (log(2 + x))6 .
We note that the mechanism that ensures existence of the long-term limit in HJM models is the
combination of the sufficiently fast flattening of the forward curve at long maturities that is ensured
by the structure of the space H , as well as sufficiently fast decay of the forward curve volatility
w
for long maturities that is ensured by the structure of the space H . In particular, the forward
w¯
curve flattens sufficiently fast for long maturities so that the long forward rate process f (∞) exists
t
and is constant (part (ii) in Theorem 2.1). The forward curve volatility decays fast enough that
the long bond volatility given by the integral (14) is well defined. Verification that the volatility of
17

the long bond (14) is well defined constitutes the key part of the proof (see Appendix).
Theorem 2.2 provides a fully explicit construction of the long-term factorization in HJM models
driven by an infinite-dimensional Brownian motion. The existence of the long bond is solely deter-
mined by the dynamics of forward curve. To ensure existence of the long bond, a sufficient condition
is imposed on the volatility of the forward curve. An obvious necessary condition is that the long
forward rate needs to be constant (if it exists), as otherwise the long bond will instantaneously
decrease to zero when there is a (necessary positive due to the theorem of Dybvig et al. (1996))
shock to the long forward rate. The framework of Filipovi´c (2001) already ensures this necessary
condition by restricting the space of forward curves and forward curve volatilities. Theorem 2 gives
a sufficient condition on the space of volatility curves that ensures existence of the long bond and
the long-term factorization of the HJM pricing kernel. In particular, Theorem 2.2 yields an explicit
∞ ∞
decomposition of the market price of risk in HJM models γ = σ +γ into a component identified
t t t
∞ ∞ ∞
with the volatility of the long bond σ and a component γ defining the martingale M and, in
t t t
Q∞
turn, the long forward measure .
3 Example: Gaussian HJM Models
Assume the initial forward curve f ∈ H with some weight w satisfying (2). When the forward
0 w
curve volatility is deterministic (independent of ω and the forward curve f ), the conditions on
t
volatility in Theorem 2.2 simplify to requiring that σ(t,ω,h) = σ(t) ∈ L0(H0) for some weight
2 w¯
O(x−(3+ǫ))
w¯ such that 1/w¯(x) = and that σ(t) is uniformly bounded. Under these assumptions,
the forward curve follows a Gaussian process taking values in H under both Q and Q∞ . It also
w
18

follows a Gaussian process in H under P if the market price of risk γ (assumed to satisfy (6)) is
w t
also deterministic. We note that this Gaussian process is generally not Markovian.
We now consider a special case with
j j −κ x
σ (t)(x) = σ (x) = σ e j , (20)
j
where σ ≥ 0, κ ≥ 0 and ∞ σ2(1 + κ ) < ∞.

Thus, σ satisfies (7). This ensures the model satisfies all assumptions in Theorem 2.2 and all

results in Theorem 2.2 hold.
To simplify notation, consider the scalar case with σ > 0 and σ = 0 for all j > 1 and drop the
1 j
index 1 in σ , which is the so-called extended Vasicek model also known as the Hull-White model.

The solution to the SDE (1) under the risk-neutral measure (setting the market price of risk γ to
t
zero) is explicit (cf. Carmona and Tehranci p.178):
σ2 t

f (x) = f (t + x) + e (1 − e )(1 − e (1 + e )/2) + σe e dW .

In the limit x → ∞, we explicitly obtain the constant long forward rate:
f (∞) = f (∞) =: λ
t 0
for all t ≥ 0 (the initial forward curve f ∈ H possesses a long forward rate f (∞), and it is
0 w 0
preserved in time under the HJM evolution as the forward curve evolves). We stress that this
example is time-inhomogeneous in general, and so here λ is defined as the limiting value of the
forward rate and is not the principal eigenfunction of the pricing semigroup as in the Markovian
case in Hansen and Scheinkman (2009).
On the other hand, letting x = 0, we have the extended Vasicek evolution for the short rate
r = f (0):

Now, in this special case with constant parameters the model is time-homogeneous Markov, and

the limiting value of the forward curve indeeds becomes the familiar principal eigenfunction in the
Vasicek model:

f (∞) = λ = θ − σ /(2κ).

This example illustrates the long-term factorization in a simple setting of Gaussian models and
makes explicit how the market price of Brownian risk γ is explicitly decomposed into the volatility
t
∞ ∞
of the long bond σ plus the market price of risk under the long forward measure γ that defines
t
∞
the martingale component M in the long term factorization. According to the recent empirical
t
evidence in the bond market, the latter component is large and highly economically significant, as
it controls the shape of the term structure of bond Sharpe ratios. We refer the reader to Qin et al.
(2016), where a particular Markovian specification is empirically estimated on the US Treasury
data. In contrast, this paper provides a general decomposition of the market price of Brownian risk
22

in non-Markovian HJM models and, in particular, in time-inhomogeneous Gaussian models, such
as the multi-factor Hull-White-type models popular in practice.
A Proof of Theorem 2
To prepare for the proof of Theorem 2, we first briefly sketch the proof of Theorem 1, referring to
Filipovi´c (2001) for details. Proof of Theorem 2.1. (i) We first consider the risk-neutral case with
γ = 0:
j Q,j
df = (Df + α (t,ω,f ))dt + σ (t,ω,f )dW . (22)
t t HJM t t t
X
j∈N
By Assumption 2.1, α (t,ω,h) is Lipschitz continuous in h and uniformly bounded (cf. Filipovi´c
HJM
(2001) Lemma 5.2.2). Thus by Theorem 2.4.1 of Filipovi´c (2001), Eq.(22) has a unique continuous
weak solution.
Uniqueness of a weak solution with non-zero γ follows by the application of Girsanov’s theorem.
We already have uniqueness of a weak solution with γ = 0. By (6), γ satisfies Novikov’s condition
(cf. Filipovi´c (2001) Lemma 2.3.2). Thus, we can define a new measure P by
t t
1
P| = exp − kγ k2 ds − γ · dWQ Q| . (23)
F t 2 Z s ℓ2 Z s s F t
(cid:16) 0 0 (cid:17)
Then by Girsanov’s theorem for infinite-dimensional Brownian motion (cf. Filipovi´c (2001))

t t s

is an infinite-dimensional standard Brownian motions under P. Thus, f is a unique weak solution
t
23

of the HJM equation (1) under P with general γ.
(ii) Since αHJM ∈ H0, f (∞) is constant.
w t
(iii) By Filipovi´c (2001) Theorem 5.2.1, zero-coupon bond price processes (PT/A ) taken rel-
t t t≥0
t
ative to the process A = eR 0 f s(0)ds are Q-martingales. This immediately yields the risk-neutral
t
factorization of the pricing kernel under P.
(iv) Filipovi´c (2001) Eq.(4.17) gives
PT t 1 t

PT t Z s s 2 Z s ℓ2

Using Eq.(24) gives the bond dynamics under P. ✷
Proof of Theorem 2.2. We are now ready for the proof of Theorem 2. The proof consists of two
parts. We first prove that the processes on the right hand side of (15) and (16) are well defined
(the integrals in the exponential are well defined). Next we prove that
EP

with M defined by the right hand side of (16). By Theorem 3.1 and 3.2 of Qin and Linetsky (2017)
t

and Proposition 2.1, (i)-(iv) follows. The expression for W then follows from Girsanov’s Theorem
t
Q∞
(cf. Filipovi´c (2001) Theorem 2.3.3), and the SDE for f under then follows immediately.

Since M = S B , we just need to prove right hand side of (15) is well defined. We first prove

Lemma A.3. For each t > 0, there exists C such that

Proof. We begin by considering the process (Y T)2 = e−(2j vT−2j v∞)−4z vT+2z vT for t ∈ [0,T]. By Itˆo’s

fact, it is a true martingale due to Lemma A.2 and Novikov’s criterion). Therefore for all v ≤ t,
EQ [e−(2j vT−2j v∞)−4z vT

Similar to Lemma A.2, |zT| ≤ 1 C2(T − v)vD2. Thus kY Tk2 = EQ [e−(2j vT−2j v∞)−4z vT+2z vT ] ≤
