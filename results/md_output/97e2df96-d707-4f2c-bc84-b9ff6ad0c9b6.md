1.2 SOP Summary 
 
Title  
 
 
Isolation of Single Rhizobia Strains 
 
 
Brief description  
 
This details the isolation of single (pure) rhizobial strains from legume nodules using standard 
sterile  techniques.  Pure  strains  are  essential  for  determining  the  symbionts  involved  in 
nodulation and Biological Nitrogen Fixation (BNF), especially if they are to be screened for their 
effectiveness at BNF and promoting plant growth with the ultimate aim of defining them as 
potential commercial inoculant strains.

2 Protocol Steps  
 
Isolation of Single Rhizobia Strains 
 
1.  Prepare 70% ethanol, 2.5 % Na hypochlorite (NaClO; 2.5% active chlorine)1, sterile distilled water. 
Sterile 1.5 mL tubes and sterile plastic pestles2. Yeast mannitol agar (YMA3) plates. 
2.  For dry nodules, soak over-night in sterile distilled water.  
For frozen nodules, allow them to thaw out. 
 
3.  Place nodules in 1.5 mL tube. 
4.  Surface sterilize nodules with 70 % ethanol for 1 min. 
5.  Sterilize nodules with 2.5 % Na hypochlorite for 3 min. 
6.  Wash with sterile water 3 times. 
7.  Squash the nodules in 1.5 mL tube using sterile plastic pestle. 
8.  Disperse the nodule juices across the YMA plate using sterile plastic pestle. 
9.  Use the same plastic pestle to spread onto next fresh YMA plate. 
10. Allow the nodule juice to sink into the plate. 
11. Incubate upside down (agar side upper-most), overnight at 28oC. Do not enclose/seal the plates 
in any way.4  
12. Check  for  growth  of  colonies,  and  select  individual  white/pale  and  mucilaginous  looking 
colonies for further growth. NB - avoid dark red colonies/growths, or those that look ‘dry’ or 
fungal. Aim to select one colony and streak this onto a fresh YMA plate. Again, incubate overnight 
at 28 oC. 
 
1 Household bleach is generally ca. 12.5 % chlorine, therefore dilute this x5. 
2 Pellet pestles Z359947-100EA Sigma-Aldrich;  
http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/sigma/z359947?lang=en&region=GB. 
3 YMA - For 1 L: 10 g of mannitol; 0.5 g of glutamate; 0.5g of K HPO ; 0.1 g of MgSO .7H O; 0.05 g of NaCl; 1 mL 
2 4 4 2
(40 g L-1) CaCl ; 1 mL (4 g L-1) FeCl ; 1g of yeast extract; 15 g technical grade agar. Add distilled water to 800 
2 3
mL and pH to 6.8. Make volume to 1L. Autoclave, and whilst still warm (~60 oC), add 10 mL.L-1 of filter sterilised 
Congo Red Stock Solution (sterile; 0.25 % [w/v]). Dispense ~20 ml per 9 cm diameter Petri dish.  
4 Fresh nodule extracts will yield cultures that generally grow well overnight. However, isolation from the other 
nodules types (dry or frozen), may take up to 3-4 days to appear as colonies that are large enough to discern 
their phenotype.

13. Once re-grown, take a single colony from the pure isolate on YMA plate and inoculate a sterile 5 
ml TY broth5. 
14. Grow the TY at 28 oC (with shaking). After 24h (at log phase), take 0.9 mL of culture and combine 
with 0.9 mL of sterile 50% glycerol. Mix and freeze in liquid-N . Store the glycerol stock at -80 oC.

15. The stock may now be used directly for bacterial DNA extractions and/or for PCR or infection 
tests.   
 
5 TY - For 1 L: 5 g of tryptone; 3 g of yeast extract; 0.913 g of CaCl .2H O. Add distilled water to almost 1L, pH to 
2 2
6.8, make volume to 1L. Autoclave. Dispense into 30 mL sterile universals (Sterilin™ Polypropylene 30mL 
Universal Containers; Catalog # : 128A; ThermoFisher) as 5 mL aliquots.
