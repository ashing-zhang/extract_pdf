Open Science has been a political priority for the European Commission since a number of years. The 
Commission is a frontrunner in this area since the publication in 2012 of the Recommendation on Access to 
and Preservation of Scientific Information, which was revised in 2018 to cover a broader spectrum of open 
science practices. The Recommendation, the development of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) and 
many other relevant research and innovation policies have played a major role in facilitating the transition 
to open science in the European Union. They have inspired and supported the adoption of relevant policies 
by countries, research performing and research funding organisations.  
The  COVID-19  pandemic  further  demonstrated  the  urgency  of  opening  science  and  its  outputs.  The 
unprecedented open collaboration and sharing of knowledge contributed in our response to the pandemic 
and to the fastest vaccines ever developed in history. While reinforcing the perception that open science 
accelerates scientific discovery, the pandemic also shed light on the need to promote its more systematic 
uptake.    
Under the new European Research Area (ERA), and through the implementation of Horizon Europe, the 
Commission is leading by example in accelerating the transition towards open science as the new normal. 
The ERA Policy Agenda for 2022-2024 features three main actions that support this transition, namely the 
development of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), working towards a copyright and data legislative 
framework that is fit for research, and the reform of research assessment to recognise a diversity of outputs, 
activities and practices in research, including those contributing to transparency and openness.  
As a research funding organisation, the European Commission has made Open Science the modus operandi 
of Horizon Europe, the EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation for the period 2021–2027. 
Horizon Europe features the most comprehensive approach to open science that we have ever seen. It 
mandates immediate open access to publications, responsible research data management, and data sharing 
under the principle ‘as open as possible, as closed as necessary’. As an important novelty, Horizon Europe 
incentivises and mainstreams open science practices by taking proper account of them in the evaluation of 
proposals and at the reporting of projects.  
I congratulate CHIST-ERA members for supporting the transition towards open science. Research funding 
organisations  have  a  crucial  role  in  promoting  open  science  practices  through  the  setting  up  and 
implementation  of  clear  policies  and  incentives.  I  am  delighted  to  see  that  the  majority  of  CHIST-ERA 
members have comprehensive open science policies in place and that this number is continuously growing. 
This report is testimony of your efforts and willingness to effect positive change and improve our research 
systems. We look forward to working together towards developing and mainstreaming open science.

Open Science can nowadays be considered a reality (or a commodity) for researchers, research performing 
organisations and research funding organisations, among many other stakeholders. My experience on Open 
Science matters is twofold: 
●  As a researcher (and practitioner), I try to apply Open Science principles as much as possible in the 
work that we carry out. Our main reason for applying Open Science is probably the reproducibility of 
our experiments. So this is not only relevant in the work that we do in our research group but also in 
all of our collaborations with other research groups worldwide. I can confirm that our efforts towards 
making all the research artefacts used in our experiments widely available and explicit pays off in the 
medium and long term, ensuring that we do not repeat once and again the same work. 
●  As the leader of the Open Science community inside a research performing organisation (Universidad 
Politécnica de Madrid), I have the task of making sure that the university has a clear roadmap towards 
Open  Science  that  goes  beyond  open  access  and  that  it  takes  into  account  the  different 
characteristics of the varied research areas that are covered by all of my colleagues. We have run 
many interviews and surveys to understand those needs and opportunities, we have been training 
early stage researchers on Open Science, and have now a roadmap that is shaping how Open Science 
is done at our university. 
Taking this into account, I really appreciate the efforts that research funding organisations such as those 
involved in CHIST-ERA are making towards making Open Science a new norm in scientific research. In fact, 
this report does not only show a status-quo towards Open Science where a large majority of the CHIST-ERA 
members are adopting Open Science policies, but also a clear evolution in the last few years that shows that 
Open Science is achieving a high level of maturity among research funding organisations. 
One aspect that I have found especially interesting when reading the report is the evolution in terms of 
considering open research data (understood in a broad sense, considering not only data but also other 
research artefacts such as software) as a key element in Open Science, beyond the well-known open access 
model for publications. This is key in the next steps to be done in this area, and CHIST-ERA members are 
already positioning in this respect,with upcoming funding calls focused on this.

Executive Summary 
Opening science and its outputs is gaining increasing attention from politicians as well as researchers. Being 
conscious and concerned by its importance, CHIST-ERA carried out an analysis among its member agencies 
regarding their national Open Science policies and practices. For this, surveys were conducted in 2019, 2020 
and 2021. The analysis is structured in two parts. The first one summarises the Status Quo in 2021, while the 
second part compares the evolution of the policies between 2019 and 2021. 
To date, a majority of the funding organisation in CHIST-ERA already have an Open Science policy and has 
institutionalised the latter through the appointment of an Open Science officer. However, the policy does 
not always apply across all funding programmes of the respective organisations. In addition, over two-thirds 
of funding organisations are members of one or more international networks promoting Open Science. This 
shows  that  those  international  networks  are  widely  regarded  as  important  for  the  promotion  and 
implementation of Open Science best practices. 
For Open Access to publications, the green and gold routes are the most popular recommended ones. 
Furthermore, most funding organisations can cover the corresponding publication fees as well as costs of 
data sharing in repositories, mainly without specific upper limits. While embargo periods are generally 
regarded as obstacles to be avoided, more than half of the funding organisations still allow embargos for the 
publication of papers and research data. The practices within funded projects are generally monitored 
through progress reports and Data Management Plans. 
The  analysis  shows  that  the  Open  Science  landscape  is  rather  mature.  In  particular,  by  analysing  the 
correlations between the different aspects covered by the analysis, we show that the handling of embargos 
should be treated with high priority, as this can be an obstacle to the open dissemination, reproducibility and 
efficiency of research. This can be partially explained by the fast pace in which Open Science practices are 
being developed and recommended by international networks and policy makers. Nevertheless, by observing 
the evolution of the landscape in the last couple of years only, it is clear that the current status is itself driven 
by a constant evolution that is expected to bring it to a much more mature stage in the near future, especially 
through new policy developments, and particularly at the level embargos for OA publications and ORD 
sharing. 
Indeed, the main conclusion of the present analysis between 2019 and 2021 is that Open Science is becoming 
part of the policies and regulations of member funding organisations. More precisely, the number of funding 
organisations with an Open Science policy is increasing over the years. Open Access to publications fees as 
well as costs for the open sharing of research data are also increasingly being supported by the funding 
organisations. The latter continue to prefer the green and gold routes and are less willing to allow embargo 
periods. On the other hand, requiring a DMP from project beneficiaries is becoming a standard, as much as 
sharing research data in specific data repositories. Finally, the number of declared Open Science officers is 
also increasing, which shows how Open Science is being anchored within the administrative organisation of 
the funding organisations. 
CHIST-ERA will continue monitoring the Open Science landscape in the upcoming years with the aim to 
confirm our prediction of a more mature landscape in the horizon of 2024–2025.

Introduction 
The openness of Science is key to ensuring its transparency and reproducibility. It has been gaining increasing 
importance with the formalisation of the concept of Open Science. Chronologically, the focus was first on 
Open Access to publications and has been ever since slowly moving toward Open Research Data.  
Being a vector of scientific excellence in Europe and beyond, CHIST-ERA is aware of the importance of Open 
Science and is proactively committed to its principles (CHIST-ERA, 2020). The level of commitment to Open 
Science of  its members  funding  organisations  is  quite  heterogeneous  in terms of  national  policies  and 
research  frameworks.  This  has  been  transparent  through  the  different  analyses  of the  European  Open 
Science landscape conducted by CHIST-ERA in 2019, 2020 and 2021. 
In the course of framing the CHIST-ERA Open Science policy (CHIST-ERA, 2021), one of the challenges was to 
set an encompassing framework based on the existing national practices. For this, and given the lack of up-
to-date and centralised data, CHIST-ERA filled in this gap by yearly surveying its members since 2019. Given 
the instrumental role it has played, the goal of the present work is to shed light on the maturity of the 
European Open Science landscape today and how it has evolved in the past couple of years. In doing so, we 
hope that it will help funding organisations and policy makers position themselves at the forefront of the 
best practices, but also enable researchers to better utilise better available opportunities and support. 
The  last  survey  was  conducted  between  July  and  September  2021  and  gathered  data  of  27  funding 
organisations coming from 25 countries. Some information was updated in March 2022 for completeness. 
In the first part of the present work (Chapter I), we present the latest available Status Quo based on a simple 
statistical evaluation of individual answers. In several cases, we analyse the interrelationships between the 
different aspects of OS Policy using the Pearson correlation between well-defined binary variables. For 
completion, an overview of features per funding organisation is presented in the annex.  
In the second part of the work (Chapter II) we analyse the evolution of the policies within the same landscape 
over time based on similar surveys conducted in 2019 and 2020. Here, the goal is twofold. On the one hand, 
we assess how the maturity of the landscape has evolved in the past few years. On the other hand, we 
extrapolate the results for the next few years, anticipating possible future directions in which the funding 
organisations are likely to evolve. 
It is important to stress that this report is based on the latest data collected in 2021 (and verified in 2022), so 
that it may not reflect very recent development in the Open Science landscape. Based on a recent consultation 
of the funding organisations, it is expected that the analysed data is still up-to-date.

Chapter 1: The European Open Science Landscape  
This section forms the basis of the analysis and maps the funding organisations' approach to Open Science 
Policy and practices that funding organisations set for projects and researchers. It also deals with the services 
they provide to them in an effort to promote Open Access to publications (OA) and to research data (ORD). 
In what follows, we analyse Open Science (OS) from the point of view of OA and ORD viewed as its main 
defining components. 
The data collected from the funding organisations are statistically evaluated and thus provide a general 
overview of the current status. For some components of particular importance, we also present the data of 
the individual funding organisations for an overview. We also perform a comparison between different 
components that are factually related. 
Part 1: Funder OS Policy & Support for Researchers 
Chart 1 Do you as a funding organisation have an Open Access policy (meaning that the researchers have 
to make their publications openly available)? 
 
In 2021, 70% funding organisations had an Open Access policy (meaning that the researchers have to make 
their publications openly available). Links to the respective OS Policies of member agencies can be found in 
Annex 3.2. 
However, the content and application of the different policies is rather heterogeneous. For instance, 62% of 
the organisations the policy is applied to all their funding programmes while for 15% of them it applies only 
in some programmes. 
To illustrate this, we provide below some instances where OS is applied only in some programmes. 
●  ERA-NETs Cofund, Programmes funded from Structural Funds (GSRT) 
●  Kappa programme funded with EEA grant (TACR) 
●  Academic R&D Supports (TÜBITAK) 
For FFG, Open Access is not obligatory but only a preferred option in all its programmes, mainly when 
research organisations are involved. It is not included in small formats such as innovation vouchers or in 
closer to the market instruments. This explains the discrepancy in total sum.

The example of GSRT (Greece) highlights the importance of programmes like CHIST-ERA, which can be a 
catalyser triggering further developments in OS. 
Chart 2 Do you propose recommendations on how publications should be accessible? 
 
The Open Access policy in a funding agency usually includes a recommendation or a requirement for a certain 
way of publishing (several options possible per organisation). Other routes are also standard (e.g. hybrid 
route) or becoming so (e.g. Diamond route). Some funding organisations are explicit and relatively strict, 
while others offer no recommendations or do not specify the conditions. The category “other” includes 
additional possibilities or requirements. 
More than half of funding organisations propose recommendations on how publications should be accessible, 
the  green  and  gold  routes  being  the  most  popular.  Note  that  a  non-negligible  fraction  (28%)  of  the 
organisations do not give any recommendation. 
An embargo designates a period of time during which a publication or research data are retained, i.e. not 
openly available. In practice, some publication venues impose embargo periods upon which authors are free 
to make a publication openly available, usually on an open repository. 
The trend in recent years is to set up a maximum period for the embargo, or even require immediate access 
to the publication. Aligned with the recommendations of Coalition S1 (cOAlitionS, 2018) and the policy of the 
European Commission, one third of organisations do not allow any embargo. When allowed, embargos are 
often limited to 6 months for scientific, technical and health sciences and 12 months for humanities and 
social sciences.  
   
 
1 cOAlition S is an initiative to make full and immediate Open Access to research publications a reality. It is built around 
Plan S, which consists of one target and 10 principles. Members of cOAlition S are European Commission, ERC and several 
national funders.

Chart 3 If self-archiving of publications is allowed, do you have specific embargo periods? How long? 
 
OA is one facet of OS, the other one being Open Research Data (ORD). This refers to the research data 
underlying a publication. Open here means making it available on an appropriate repository. We define 
Research data as the evidence that underpins the answer to the research question, and can be used to validate 
findings regardless of its form (e.g. print, digital, or physical) (CORD, 2016). ORD is a younger avenue and is 
therefore less mature. We now focus on the embargo periods for ORD. 
Table 1 Comparison of Embargo for OA and ORD 
Embargo for publications allowed  Embargo for research data allowed 
66%  78% 
It is evident that the number of funding organisations allowing embargos on publications and research data 
is comparable. However, there is no clear correlation between embargos in specific funding organisations. 
This is also confirmed through statistical correlation analysis (see Part 5 below). 
Data management Plans 
Data Management Plans (DMPs) are a key element towards good data management. A DMP describes the 
data management life cycle for the data to be collected, processed and/or generated by a project. They 
usually include descriptions of data that will be collected or generated, the handling of research data during 
and after the end of the project, whether data will be shared or made openly available and how data will be 
curated & preserved (including after the end of the project). 
Not  only  the  European  Commission  (EC)  but  also  other  funding  organisations  are  gradually  requiring 
researchers to develop a DMP. At the same time, they also require data to be shared on an open repository. 
Currently, while 56% funding organisations ask their researchers to produce a Data Management Plan, only 
44% require their data to be published on a repository (for details regarding the policies of specific agencies, 
see the overview table in Part 5).

Guidelines and webinars 
Given the relative novelty of Open Science policies and the diversity in the required practices, funding 
organisations usually provide guidelines and guidance to researchers. 
Table 3 Comparison of Guidelines on OA and ORD 
OA Guidelines provided  ORD Guidelines provided 
63%  56% 
The table compares the availability of guidelines for researchers on Open Access on one side and on Open 
Research Data on the other side. We notice that there are more funding organisations offering guidelines for 
OA to publications than funding agencies offering ORD guidelines. However, clear from Table 4, those funding 
organisations are not always the same. Our interpretation is that the level of maturity of the different funding 
organisations is very heterogeneous. Indeed, given that open access to publication is better understood and 
practiced in general, there is a higher need for open research data guidelines. The organisations providing 
only open research data guidelines are very likely to be relatively more at the forefront of open science best 
practices.  On  the other  hand,  those  providing  guidelines  for open access only  are  expected  to  be  less 
advanced in terms of open science. 
Chart 4 Do you organise Open Access/Open Data webinars? 
 
Thirty-five percent of the funding organisations organise Open Access or Open Research Data webinars. They 
organise  them  irregularly,  when  significant  changes  are  implemented.  Some  funding  organisations 
participate in or recommend activities organised by others.

| 63%                      | 56%                       |

Part 2: Open Access Fees 
OA  publications  and  ORD  are  available  free  of  charge  for  the  user,  but  they  generally  incur  costs  for 
researchers. This includes costs of publishing (especially in the gold route) and storing publications or data in 
a repository. The researcher must also prepare the publication and data in a suitable form. 
This part describes various types of OA and ORD fees that can be supported by funding organisations. 
Chart 5 Supported Open Access fees 
 
The majority of funding organisations can cover Open Access publication fees. Article Processing Charges are 
the most popular charges funding organisations can cover – 40% of funding organisations can cover it. About 
one quarter of the funding organisations do not cover any of Open Access costs.  
Most organisations (83%) do not set any specific limit on Processing Charges. Other organisations have 
specific conditions as outlined below. 
●  FWF has specific limits on supported costs depending on the type of publication and venue, see (FWF, 
2022) and (FWF). 
●  NCN has no specific cap and grantees can use up to 2% of overheads for these charges. If needed, 
the grantees can cover the fees from “general overheads” (20% of the direct costs). 
●  FNR has specific limits depending on the route (e.g. 2500€ for Gold OA) 
●  F.R.S.-FNRS has an upper limit of 750€ 
●  UKRI provides annual block grants to research institutions/universities to cover the cost for OA 
publications. This is for the research institutions to manage and allocate. Cost for OA publications 
cannot be requested on individual grants. 
 
Financial support of open sharing of research data 
In the case of data, 70% of funding organisations can financially support open sharing of research data, 
generally without any upper limit. Only in exceptional cases limits do apply. For instance, the SNSF financially 
supports data preparation and archiving data on data repositories complying with the FAIR data principles 
up to 10’000 CHF per research grant. 
   
 
12 
 

Part 3: Non-monetary tools to promote OS 
Open Science can be supported in various ways. One of them is the financial support, which we analysed in 
the  previous  section.  However,  the  possibilities  for  funding  organisations  are  much  wider.  They  can 
recommend an open approach, require it in the conditions of competitions, consider it in the evaluation of 
projects, recommend suitable tools, organise trainings and seminars. We now analyse the use of some of 
these incentives. 
Chart 6 What tools do you use to support Open Science? 
 
Funding organisations use both monetary and non-monetary tools to promote Open Science. One third of 
the funding organisations include Open Science within the evaluation criteria. Note that CHIST-ERA explicitly 
includes  Open  Science  in  its  evaluation  criteria  since  the  Call  2019  (CHIST-ERA,  2019).  22%  of  the 
organisations do not use any non-monetary incentives. Some organisations use other specific non-monetary 
tools like the following.  
●  ANR makes available an online DMP tool (OPIDoR) and has set a specific portal in the national 
repository HAL (ANR). 
●  Swedish Research Council and Academy of Finland: Open Science is compulsory. 
●  The SNSF is a member of Europe PMC (providing SNSF grantees access to their OA repositories). 
Note that no organisation systematically employs OS experts in the evaluation process. This indicates that 
OS is not treated as an evaluation criterion of the same importance as other standard criteria such as 
Excellence or Originality. This is not surprising since the basis of funding decisions is based on the latter 
standard criteria, while OS is rather a transversal aspect. Nevertheless, it would be interesting to explore 
whether evaluation panel members are trained on OS best practices as part of their mandate. 
The possible ways of monitoring Open Science are diverse. Chart 7 summarises the types of monitoring tools 
used for following-up the application of the Open Science practices. 
   
 
13 
 

Chart 7 What types of monitoring tools do you use for following-up the application of the Open Science 
practices? 
 
The most frequent monitoring tools used for following-up the application of the Open Science practices are 
progress reports (40%) and DMP updates (23%).  About one quarter of funding organisations do not mention 
any monitoring tools. Four funding organisations have other specific monitoring tools. 
●  TA CR requires principal investigators (PI) to provide references and an abstract of all scientific 
publications relating to the results of the project at the latest 60 days following publication. 
●  Research Council of Lithuania monitors through mid-term and final project evaluations. 
●  SNSF: The SNSF offers a service for researchers to check their individual Open Access status (SNSF). 
It is clear that Monitoring is one of the biggest challenges for funding organisations in following-up on the 
implementation of national funding regulations. As can be seen from the examples above, there is a variety 
of tools, some of which are currently under discussion or evaluation. This begs for a comprehensive - possibly 
pan-European - solution ensuring an efficient and reliable monitoring of OS practices at the project level. As 
part of the European landscape, CHIST-ERA is currently testing a solution provided by OpenAIRE for the 
monitoring of project beneficiaries (OpenAIRE). 
   
 
14 
 

Part 4: Other Open Science Initiatives 
Chart 8 Is your organisation a member of any international network promoting Open Science? (like Science 
Europe) 
 
Two-thirds of funding organisations are members of one or more international networks promoting Open 
Science. Science Europe, EOSC and CoalitionS are the most popular ones. Other networks or initiatives 
include DORA, OpenAIRE, RDA Europe 4.0, NI4OS project (National Initiatives for Open Science), SCOAP3 
(Sponsoring Consortium for Open Access Publishing in Particle Physics), RIPE NCC (Réseaux IP Européens 
Network Coordination Center), ICOLC (International Coalition of Library Consortia), EGI Foundation, GÉANT, 
EuroHPC and G7 Open Science Working Group. 
There is a clear tendency to be strongly involved in European or international initiatives. This means that 
funding organisations acknowledge the importance of the latter for OS and staying at the forefront of best 
practices. It also indicates that Open Science has an underlying Community feature, which goes beyond 
national considerations. 
Chart 9 Did your organisation sign any declaration/memorandum regarding any Open Science-related 
topic? (like DORA declaration)  
 
 
15 
 

The majority of respondents has not signed any declaration or memorandum regarding Open Science. Out of 
11 organisations that have signed a declaration or memorandum, 6 mentioned that their organisation has 
signed the DORA Declaration. Among other declarations, we also noted the Berlin Declaration, the EOSC 
Declaration, the Hong Kong Principles, the OA2020 and Plan S.  
Chart  10  Do  you  take  part  in  any  ongoing  external  initiatives  promoting  Open  Science  in  your 
country/region? 
 
In total, 42% of funding organisations participate in ongoing external initiatives promoting Open Science in 
their country or region, which are very heterogeneous. The situation is rather heterogeneous. Funding 
organisations are open to participating in various networks (or even coordinate them) and projects. Some 
also mention active participation in international activities. Specific answers can be found in Table 11 of the 
Annex.

In this section, we analyse the correlations between a number of aspects of OS policies that admit a binary 
description. For each such aspect, we attribute a binary variable (0 or 1) and we compute the Pearson 
correlation (Pearson, 1895) between all the variables2. The latter is defined as the normalised covariance of 
two variables. For a discrete sample of two variables 𝑥 and 𝑦, it can be computed as 
𝑛 𝑛
∑ (𝑥 −𝑥 )∑ (𝑦 −𝑦 )
𝑖=1 𝑖 0 𝑖=1 𝑖 0 , 
√∑𝑛 (𝑥 −𝑥 )2√∑𝑛 (𝑦 −𝑦 )2
𝑖=1 𝑖 0 𝑖=1 𝑖 0
where 𝑥  and 𝑦  are the means of  𝑥 and 𝑦 respectively and 𝑛 is the number of data points. The Pearson 
0 0
correlation ranges from -1 to 1. The values -1 and 1 indicate a linear relation between the variables and the 
sign translates the way in which the variables vary in this relationship. For instance, if the correlation is 1, 
then  𝑥 increases as 𝑦 does. In what follows, the sign will be described as positive or negative correlation. On 
the other hand, a zero correlation translates to the absence of linear dependence between the variables. 
Given the qualitative nature of the analysis, we assume that a correlation exists if the absolute value of the 
Pearson correlation is strictly bigger that 0,5. It is worth stressing that the Pearson correlation is only used as 
a way to detect correlations  whose plausibility is confirmed through a qualitative analysis. Spurious or 
nonsensical relationships will not be discussed. 
Open Science Policy 
Let us first consider the existence of an OS policy. It is positively correlated with the application of the policy 
in all funding programmes as well as with the formulation of recommendation for routes (for OA publications) 
and the obligation of submission of a DMP. We interpret this as a definition of an OS Policy. Namely, the latter 
consists in a set of recommendations or obligations for OA publications and for data management that apply 
to all programmes of a funding organisation. On the other hand, OS policy is uncorrelated from embargo 
restrictions on publications and data sharing. In other words, there is no apparent dependency between the 
existence of an OS policy and the regulations on how embargos are handled. This means that embargos are, 
to  date,  not  considered  homogeneously  across  funding  organisations.  Consequently,  this  aspect  is  not 
mature  enough  at  the  policy  level  and  could  benefit  from  high-level  exchanges  between  funding 
organisations. 
Financial Support 
In CHIST-ERA, we view an OS policy as an opportunity for researchers to increase the impact and the value of 
their works and to benefit from financial support in order to facilitate the process of open sharing of scientific 
results. If one considers the existence of national financial support for OA publications and sharing of ORD, it 
is easy to show that those two aspects are negatively correlated with the existence of upper limits on such 
funding opportunities. In other words, whenever such fees are covered, there are usually no upper limits. 
Grant beneficiaries have therefore the full freedom in choosing their publication venues independently of 
any financial considerations. This could be explained by the fact that the OA and ORD market is rather well 
regulated and that offers of service providers are reasonably aligned. It would be interesting to analyse the 
landscape of service providers in order to confirm this assumption. 
When we consider the tolerance of embargos for publications and data sharing, we find no correlation3 at all 
with the corresponding financial support. This is quite surprising and shows, once again, that embargos are 
still tolerated. This is further evidence and support for the direction in which the OS landscape should further 
mature. 
 
2 A more thorough statistical analysis will be performed at a later stage. 
3 The Pearson correlation here is almost 0!

Data Sharing 
Consider the obligation of open data sharing. It is positively correlated to the obligation of providing a DMP, 
which shows that both aspects are intimately related in the process of developing an OS policy. If we now 
consider, additionally, the recommendation on routes for OA publications, we also find a positive correlation. 
Even if those aspects are not qualitatively related in the sense that OA and ORD developments can be 
independent from one another, this shows a certain level of maturity in the OS landscape in the form of “all 
or none”. 
Summary 
In short, the analysis of correlations between all binary variables of the OS analysis shows that the OS 
landscape is rather mature in the sense that the development of an OS policy usually considers a cluster of 
different aspects in order to define the content of the policy. This leads to a natural circumstantial definition 
of an OS policy. On the other hand, the analysis also shows a number of directions where the landscape 
should  further  mature  through  new  policy  developments,  especially  at  the  level  embargos  for  OA 
publications and ORD sharing.

Chapter 2: Evolution 2019 – 2021 
In this chapter, we exploit the multiyear data collected between 2019 and 2021 in order to estimate how the 
Open Science landscape evolved in recent years and predict possible future evolutions. The number of 
respondents in each year fluctuated around 25. The list of funding organisations participating in each year is 
given in Table 3.1. in Annex 3. 
Part 1: Funder OS Policy & Support for Researchers 
Chart 11 Do you have an Open Access policy (meaning that the researchers have to make their publications 
openly available)? 
 
The number of funding organisations that have an Open Access policy has slightly increased in 2021. Given 
the short timescale, this is not negligible and the growth trend is clearly visible. 
Chart 12 Recommendations on how publications should be available 
 
 
21 
 

Funding  organisations  that  make  recommendations  to  their  recipients  regarding  the  availability  of 
publications mostly recommend the green and the gold routes. In 2021, the number of funding organisations 
that do not make any recommendations increased. The hybrid route is not popular and is often explicitly 
excluded. 
Due to the effort to ensure consistency between the data points over the years in order to evaluate the 
evolution of the landscape, we did not include recent developments such as the diamond route or other 
publishing platforms. 
Chart 13 Embargo periods 
 
As for embargos, the most popular option is to allow a maximum of six months (scientific, technical and 
health  sciences)  or  12  months  (humanities  and  social  sciences).  An  increasing  number  of  funding 
organisations do not allow any embargo period at all, which is likely to be related to participation in Plan S. 
The general trend is to reduce the embargo to a minimum. Organisations without an OS policy are more likely 
to allow the embargo than those with a clear OS Policy. 
Chart 14 DMP 
 
 
22 
 

Between 2019 and 2021, the obligation to develop a DMP increased by 21%. This is a significant increase 
compared to 2019, when a large number of scientists did not have to produce a DMP and, subsequently, to 
manage and to share data. This indicates an increasing emphasis on the importance of data management.  
Nevertheless, as one can see from chart 2.5, the obligation of researchers to deposit their data in a repository 
increased by 8% only. 
Chart 15 Data repository obligations 
 
 
Chart 16 Embargo on data allowed 
 
An increasing number of funding organisations allow embargo on research data, which means that even 
though  researchers  do  have  to  share  their  research  data  openly  on  a  data  repository,  78%  of  the 
organisations still allow embargo periods.  
   
 
23 
 

Part 2: Open Access Fees 
Chart 17 Open Access fees supported 
 
In terms of Open Access fees, organisations most often cover Article Processing Charges (slightly increasing 
trends) and Book Processing Charges. The number of "Other" and "None" responses is slightly decreasing, 
the distribution of other responses remains at approximately the same level. 
Chart 18 Data Sharing fees can be covered 
 
The number of funding organisations that can financially support open sharing of research data (on data 
repositories) significantly increased to 70% in 2021. Most funding organisations do not set any upper limit.

Part 3: Non-monetary tools to promote OS 
Chart 19 Tools to support Open Science 
 
The  tools  to  support  Open  Science  are  diverse.  The  use  of  OS  within  the  evaluation  criteria  is  quite 
widespread among the funding organisations. The fraction of organisations without any such measures or 
tools is surprisingly increasing. On the other hand, despite the negligible figures, resorting to OS experts in 
the evaluation process has taken off, which may signal a trend. It would be interesting to see if the latter is 
confirmed in the next years. 
Chart 20 Monitoring tools 
 
Progress reports and DMP updates became the most popular options to monitor the applications of Open 
Science practices. The number of funding organisations that do not monitor progress in the OS has strongly 
decreased. The bibliography is used only marginally for monitoring.    
 
25 
 

Chart 21 Is there an Open Access and/or open Research Data officer in your funding organisation? 
 
The number of funding organisations with Open Access and / or Open Research Data officers is slightly 
growing. In other words, there is an increasing awareness of the importance of OS, such that it is being more 
and more anchored or institutionalised in funding organisations
