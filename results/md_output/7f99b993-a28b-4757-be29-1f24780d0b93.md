EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
About the EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: 
Summaries are useful for people who have neither the time nor the inclination to read a lengthy 
document but who want to scan the primary points quickly and then decide whether they need 
to read the entire version. 
A  summary  should  be  short  enough  to  be  economical  and  long  enough  to  be  clear  and 
comprehensive. Don't sacrifice meaning for brevity. A short, confusing summary will take more 
of a busy executive's time than a somewhat longer but clear one. 
It should stand alone (hence do not refer to section numbers or WPs). 
●  It focuses on results (findings, conclusions, and recommendations). 
●  It typically provides some motivation for why the problem is interesting.  
●  It typically mentions the research methodology.  
●  It does NOT need to provide a section-by-section summary.

Please insert them as endnotes (apply ‘1, 2, 3, …’ number format). For example, reference to [] 
and reference to []. If you want to refer again to a reference that was already inserted earlier in 
the text, you can use the ‘Insert Cross-reference’ function and select ‘Endnote’. Then select the 
right reference and click ‘Insert’. For example, here we refer again to the first reference [1]. 
The use of endnotes allows you to insert references at any place at any time. Reordering 
happens automatically (which is not the case when using numbered items and is hence a big 
disadvantage of numbered items). The main disadvantage of using endnotes is that they do not 
support brackets automatically. Another disadvantage is that endnotes always appear at the 
very end of the document. If appendices are added at the end of the document, they will be 
inserted before the references. Fortunately, appendices are rarely used in deliverables. 
In order to obtain references between square brackets, you should follow the steps below: 
1.  Square brackets need to be typed manually for each reference that is inserted. The easiest 
way to do so, is to first type the brackets and then insert the endnote in between the 
brackets. 
2.  When the deliverable is in a final shape (meaning that no more references need to be 
added), the square brackets need to be added manually at the end of the document in the 
‘References’ section. 
3.  Please also insert a tab between the closing bracket and the reference text in order to obtain 
a clean alignment of the references. This is not really user-friendly, but unfortunately, there 
is no better alternative. 
4.  Be  careful  to  insert  references  when  the  document  is  in  ‘track  changes’  mode.  Track 
changes may screw up numbering when cutting & pasting text including references. 
5.  Do NOT use ‘numbered lists’ for adding references. This approach will show references in 
the text in a non-ordered way. 
Notice that cross references among sections and references to pictures and tables should be 
inserted as cross-references to numbered items so that when shifting around things in the 
document, the links will be automatically updated when saving it. 
Sometimes for URLs, you may want to use the footnote option2 rather than the reference 
option as explained above.
