MAPPING OF EXISTING AND PROPOSALS FOR NEW 
PT SCHEMES 
 
 
Mapping  of  existing  and  proposals  for  new  Proficiency  Tests  /  External  Quality 
Assurance schemes 
1. Introduction 
1.1. Background 
The objective of EJP-CARE is to enhance collaboration between the public health, food and animal 
health sectors across the European Union (EU), in order to increase joint preparedness, in relation to 
bacterial zoonotic (especially foodborne) infections as mentioned in the priority topics. The project will 
be setting standards for quality assurance testing that will strengthen  already existing systems for 
proficiency testing, reference material and quality/availability of demographic data. 
In the EU, networks exist of European and national reference labs for various microorganisms.  EC DG-
SANTE funds the European reference laboratories serving the food and veterinary sector , whereas  the 
European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) supports the  established network of 
laboratories within the European Food- and Waterborne Diseases and Zoonoses Network (FWD-Net). 
ECDC  does  not  currently  have  reference  laboratories  but  conduct  different  reference  laboratory 
activities, e.g. different quality assurance schemes, using subcontractors. The “non-human” European 
Reference Laboratories (EURLs) and the “human” ECDC FWD network of laboratories are coordinating 
activities at different levels due to the individual specific terms of references.  One of the objectives of 
these  networks  is  to  ensure  harmonization  throughout  the  EU  in  the  capacity  for  detection  and 
characterization  of  food  borne  microorganisms.  Collaboration  between  veterinary,  food, and  public 
health laboratories  and the need for exchange of data is increasing, and therefore calls for systems that 
can ensure the comparability  of results. To facilitate the comparability of results, a One Health system 
of  quality  assurance  testing,  preferably  in  the  form  of  Proficiency  Tests  (PTs)  or  External  Quality 
Assurance schemes (EQAs) (see Intermezzo), to be used cross sectorial would help. 
 
1.2. Approach  
Before microorganisms can be identified/characterized, they have to be detected and isolated. 
Although the approaches used for the analysis of samples in the different sectors are different, the end 
point is to detect and isolate microorganisms. For detection and isolation of pathogenic microorganisms 
in samples from the food chain mostly validated internationally standardized (CEN/ISO) methods are 
used, thus ensuring harmonization within the food sector. For the animal health sector, the World 
Organization for Animal Health (OIE) has issued reference methods, but for the public health sector 
there are currently no reference methods in place at the EU level.  
 
Most important common feature for all three sectors is the result: one or more strains to be 
characterized. At the stage of identification/characterization differences between the domains no longer 
exist. This is schematically depicted in Figure 1.

Figure 1. Detection and characterization of microorganisms from human and non-human samples. 
 
 
For decades, phenotypic characteristics have been used for identification/characterization of 
microorganisms. In the recent years the focus in identification/characterization methods has shifted 
towards  molecular  techniques,  such  as  Multi  Locus  Sequence  Typing  (MLST),  Pulsed  Field    Gel 
Electrophoresis  (PFGE)  and  Multi  Locus  Variable  number  of  tandem  repeats  Analysis  (MLVA). 
Nowadays, laboratories switch more and more to Next Generation (NGS)/Whole Genome Sequencing 
(WGS) techniques, as these approach have rapidly expanded the possibilities for discriminating or 
confirming identity of strains. 
Standardization and quality control of earlier molecular techniques (MLST, PFGE, MLVA etc.) 
is/was quite well organized by the ECDC network and the EURLs. Standardization and quality control 
of NGS/WGS techniques is being developed, but is as yet still far from ideal. Reasons for this may be 
the rapid changing range of machinery/platforms used for NGS/WGS, and the improvement  in in-silico 
techniques that can be carried out for characterizing microorganisms. Many steps are involved from an 
isolate to a full identification/characterization of the isolate. Also, in case of comparison of isolates, many 
steps  are  involved  to conclude  that  the  characteristics  of strains,  isolated  in  different sectors,  are 
identical or not. Since NGS/WGS techniques are rapidly developing, it makes sense to rather evaluate 
results of analyses than to evaluate methods that are being used. Questions that could be raised are: 
can you identify a clonal cluster, which generic criteria did you use to call the cluster: MLST schemes, 
SNPs etc., and how did you define which bacteria should be included in the cluster. Similar questions 
could be raised for detection of virulence or toxins, and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) gene detection 
For quality assurance schemes throughout both sectors there is a general need  for OneHealth 
PT/EQA-schemes and reference materials directed towards NGS/WGS techniques throughout the EU. 
 
1.3. Aim of the work 
Proficiency testing (PT) schemes or External Quality Assurance (EQA) schemes is an integrated 
part of quality assurance management for laboratories within the field of human and veterinary medical 
microbiology, and in microbiology of the food chain. The aim of this Work Package of EJP-CARE is to 
develop guidance for proficiency testing schemes that can be used cross-sectorial. This will be done by 
mapping the currently available PTs/EQAs and assess the usefulness of these schemes in a cross-
sectorial context and by developing proposals for new PT/EQA schemes that can accommodate unmet 
and new needs.

This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 
research and innovation programme under Grant Agreement No 773830. 
 
The  rapid  emergence  of  WGS  methodologies  for  characterization  of  pathogens  including 
analytical approaches that can predict virulence factors, antimicrobial resistance, clonal relationship, 
and identify food- and water borne outbreaks is an area where there is a need for new cross-sectorial 
PT/EQA schemes. Likewise, in the area of molecular based methodologies, including WGS, for culture-
free detection/identification of pathogens in complex sample material new PT/EQA schemes are needed. 
In order to facilitate the development of the new PT/EQA proposals this Work Package (WP) 
will include a number of well-designed pilot PTs/EQAs that will be performed among the WP participants. 
The WP will be concluded by developing a final guidance document giving specific recommendations in 
relation to which PTs/EQAs that should  be prioritized and containing specific guidance  on how to 
perform the proposed cross-sectorial PTs/EQAs. 
The WP will be divided into three parts (tasks): 
•  Mapping of existing quality assurance schemes and proposals for new PT/EQA schemes 
•  Pilot trials (organized as sub-tasks) and documentation of outcome 
•  Development of guidance document and proposals for Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) 
where appropriate with suggestions for design of future cross-sectorial PT schemes 
 
Task 1 of this WP 1 aims at preparing an inventory of existing PT/EQA schemes, to discern the 
possible gaps, and to propose new PTs/EQAs for cross-sectorial use. 
For  this  the  focus  will  be  on  PT/EQA  schemes  for  identification/characterization: what  is  currently 
available, what is planned and what is necessary in the near future. 
 
Since in this EJP-CARE project the focus is on cross-sectorial quality assurance, the inventory 
for Task 1 is set, as explained before, at the lower part of Figure 1, the characterization of isolates.

3. Availability of PT-schemes for (molecular) characterization: 
In the EU, various organizations are responsible for the different sectors (public health, food and 
animal health). Each of these organizations funds or organizes PTs/EQAs.  
Next to these EU organizations there is a number of commercial PT/EQA providers for food-borne and 
zoonotic microorganisms. 
In the following sections, PTs organized for (molecular) characterization, and organized by one of the 
above mentioned organizations are listed. For this overview, only PTs are mentioned that somehow 
deal with characterization of microorganisms.

2) PTs/EQAs organized by the European Reference Laboratories 
Laboratories for which PTs/EQAs are intended: ‘non-human’ National Reference Laboratories (NRLs) 
of network of relevant EURL 
 
a) EURL-Listeria 
-  Has organized in 2017: PT on MLST typing 
-  Has organized in 2018 PT on WGS cluster analysis by SNP or cg-MLST 
-  Will organize in 2019 and 2020 PT on typing, method free of choice (molecular serotyping, 
PFGE, MLLST, WGS). Participants will indicate which method they applied. 
 
b) EURL-E. coli (2,3) 
-  Since 2008, has organized approximately once a year PTs for identification and typing of 
pathogenic E. coli, mainly STEC, focusing on serotyping and virulence genes 
identification. 
-  In 2010 and 2012 has organized joint studies with the WHO Collaborating Centre for 
Reference and Research on Escherichia and Klebsiella, Statens Serum Institute, 
Copenhagen (SSI), in charge for the EQA program for the ECDC network of the medical 
NRLs for VTEC referring to the ECDC Food- and Waterborne Diseases and Zoonoses 
Surveillance Program. The aim of such a liaison was the harmonization of the typing 
methods used by both the NRL networks, to make the respective monitoring programs 
and databases compatible for comparison of data referring to human and non-human 
isolates of VTEC. The two studies mainly targeted virulotyping and serotyping of 
pathogenic E. coli. (2, 3). Despite these studies were performed with the cross-sectorial

approach, no joint report was produced and results were compared among the networks 
at the annual EURL workshop. 
-  Six PTs on molecular typing through PFGE were conducted since 2012. 
-  Has organized in 2017 PT on DNA-extraction and NGS (in house methods collaborating 
labs (4). Output: raw (Fastq files).  
EURL  used  in-house  pipeline  for  quality  check/trimming/assembly/assembly 
statistics/MLST/sero- and virulotyping/phylogenetic analysis. 
Aim 1: evaluation of quality parameters of the sequences and their effect on characterization 
of STEC by WGS. 
Aim 2: evaluate interlab and platform variability in SNPs and allelic differences. 
-  Has performed in 2018 (5) and in 2019 PTs on identification and typing of STECs and 
other types of E. coli. Method free of choice. If performed WGS results could be reported 
instead of conventional methods. A similar approach will be used in 2020 and 2021. 
Aims: 10 correct identification of strains, and 2) correct  identification of cluster of strains 
based on WGS, included from 2019. 
 
c) EURL-Campylobacter 
-  In 2019 and in 2020 a (voluntary) PT on subtyping C. jejuni by sending out pre-extracted 
DNA to sequence by any method. 
Method: report MLST-types and do cluster analysis/submit raw data/assemblies/cluster 
images (in case WGS is performed) 
Aim: identify differences in methods and the extent of deviations in results. 
-  In 2020 organized a  PT to assess performance of DNA-extraction and WGS. Submission 
of lyophilized C. jejuni isolates and DNA extracts. Evaluation against reference genome 
and quality parameters. 
 
d) EURL-Salmonella 
-  Organizes annually a PT on serotyping of Salmonella. 
-  2013-2018: included also PFGE typing in the PTs on serotyping of Salmonella. 
-  2019 (and onward) included also cluster analysis (molecular method free of choice) in the 
PTs on serotyping of Salmonella. 
 
e) EURL-Antimicrobial Resistance 
-  In 2020, the EURL AR has planned to organize a genomic PT assessing genomic metrics,  
characterization and typing of bacterial cultures and prediction of phenotypic AMR  based 
on cultures and pre-extracted DNA of PH relevant bacterial species including E.coli, 
Salmonella, Campylobacter. 
Aim:  evaluate  consistency  and  robustness  of  labs  to  perform  DNA-extraction/library 
preparation/WGS. Own choice of protocols/software/sequencing platforms, assessed by 
coverage/reads/size compared to closed ref genome/phred score/insert size/sequencing 
depth/phylogeny/prediction of MLST/AMR genes.  
 
f) EURL-Parasites 
-  No plans for PTs on molecular characterization in the coming years due to lack of NGS 
activities in most of the networks NRLs. 
 
Things to bear in mind (upon recommendations of the WG NGS EURLs) 
-  Identify synergies spanning more than one EURL network and coordinate with ECDC 
-  Make submission of data and sequences as simple as possible for both supplier and 
participant

4. Summary 
The  rapid  emergence  of  whole  genome  DNA  sequencing  (WGS)  methodologies  for 
characterization  of  pathogens  including  analytical  approaches  that  can  predict  virulence  factors, 
antimicrobial resistance, clonal relationship, and identify food- and water borne warrant the need for new 
cross-sectorial quality assurance schemes to be used in the veterinary, food and public health sectors. 
Likewise,  in  the  area  of  molecular  based  methodologies,  including  WGS,  for  culture-free 
detection/identification of pathogens in complex sample material new quality assurance schemes are 
needed. 
 
This inventory on existing PT/EQA schemes, carried out within the framework of Task 1 of Work 
Package 1 of this EJP-CARE project, shows that in Europe many PT/EQA-schemes for food borne 
pathogens  are  available.  Most  of  these  schemes,  however,    focus  on  isolation,  detection  and 
enumeration, and not on detailed characterization/(sub)typing of isolates. 
 
Even though ECDC, several EURLs, and other institutes provide PT/EQA schemes meant to 
evaluate molecular methods for characterization/(sub)typing of isolates, most of these PTs/EQAs are 
either  intended  for  the  public  health  laboratories  (ECDC)  or  for  the  non-public  health  laboratories 
(EURLs). No indication was found that PTs/EQAs currently exist that are intended for laboratories from 
each of the veterinary, food or public health sector as meant in the OneHealth principle.

5. Conclusion 
Various  molecular  methods  for  comparing  microorganisms  isolated  from  different  samples 
(human and non-human), are increasingly used to (sub)type the isolates. Nowadays, WGS/NGS has 
become the method of choice to perform this (sub)typing. To be able to compare the outcomes of the 
(sub)typing  performed  by  the  different  laboratories,  for  example  within  the  framework  of  outbreak 
investigation, it is important to know that the typing techniques are performed at equal quality in the 
different laboratories. For this reason quality Proficiency Tests/External Quality Assurance schemes, in 
which the different organizations participate, are invaluable. Only then isolates can be compared making 
it possible to identify possible sources of an outbreaks. Better comparison  of results also leads to 
improved collaboration between the different sectors, and more harmonization of methodologies. 
In addition to participation in quality assurance schemes, also the regular use of (appropriate) reference 
materials is important to show the quality of the laboratories. 
 
Up until now, several organizations (ECDC, EURLs) have started to conduct PTs/EQAs in the 
field of WGS/NGS as shown in this inventory. However, these PTs/EQAs are mainly intended for each 
different network of laboratories, like network of public health FWD laboratories (ECDC), network of 
NRLs-E. coli (EURL-E. coli), network of NRLs-Salmonella (EURL-Salmonella),  etc.  In the  EURLs 
working group on NGS it was already concluded that cross-sectorial PTs/EQAs for the various EURL 
networks is highly recommended. But, also from the One Health point of view, cross-sectorial PTs/EQAs 
for  human  and  non-human  laboratories  are  recommended,  in  order  to  be  able  to  compare  the 
performance of the different laboratories when (sub)typing isolates.  
 
From the inventory described in this report can be concluded that none of the existing PTs/EQAs 
cover all the different sectors. Therefore, new PTs/EQAs have to be developed  covering all three 
sectors  involved  in  One  Health.  The  focus  must  be  on  new  molecular,  preferably  WGS-based, 
methodologies, that are being used cross-sectorial. The areas covered will include both wet and dry 
laboratory procedures, and include detection of pathogens in primary materials and methods used for 
characterization of isolates. 
 
Pilot PTs/EQAs organized among the CARE participants will support the development of the 
new PT/EQA schemes. A further, and novel component, is to develop a PT/EQA scheme where the 
proficiency in the speed of response to an outbreak is assessed.  The outcome will be a guidance 
document giving specific recommendations in relation to which PTs/EQAs should be prioritized and 
containing specific guidance on how to perform the proposed cross-sectorial Pts/EQAs. 
 
Designing cross-sectorial PTs/EQAs and carrying out pilot-PTs/EQAs can be done within the 
set-up of EJP-CARE. For the long term, and continuity of such PTs/EQAs many things still have to be 
arranged. Like, who will be the lead institute for long term existing PTs/EQAs, where do the strains/DNA 
come from, and how is ownership of materials and data arranged. 
For  PTs/EQAs  aimed  at  investigating  outbreaks  with  food-borne  pathogens,  metadata  have  to  be 
available as well. Therefore, also thought has to be given to the ownership of metadata, privacy-issues 
when exchanging metadata between various laboratories. 
These questions are not to be answered within the framework of Task 1 of Work package 1 of EJP-
CARE, but must certainly be taken into account before the end of this project.
